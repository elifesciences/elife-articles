animal viruses are spread by insect vectors. Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) is aphid-transmitted, with the virus being taken up from specialized transmission bodies (TB) formed within infected plant cells. However, the precise events during TB-mediated virus acquisition by aphids are unknown. Here, we show that TBs react instantly to the presence of the vector by ultra-rapid and reversible redistribution of their key components onto microtubules throughout the cell. Enhancing or inhibiting this TB reaction pharmacologically or by using a mutant virus enhanced or inhibited transmission, respectively, confirming its requirement for efficient virus-acquisition. Our results suggest that CaMV can perceive aphid vectors, either directly or indirectly by sharing the host perception. This novel concept in virology, where viruses respond directly or via the host to the outside world, opens new research horizons, that is, investigating the impact of &#x2018;perceptive behaviors&#x2019; on other steps of the infection cycle.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00183.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00183.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00183.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Viruses are infectious agents that can replicate only inside a living host cell. When a virus infects an animal or plant, it introduces its own genetic material and tricks the host cells into producing viral proteins that can be used to assemble new viruses. An essential step in the life cycle of any virus is transmission to a new host: understanding this process can be crucial in the fight against viral epidemics.</p><p>Many viruses use living organisms, or vectors, to move between hosts. In the case of plant viruses such as cauliflower mosaic virus, the vectors are often aphids. When an aphid sucks sap out of a leaf, virus particles already present in the leaf become attached to its mouth, and these viruses can be transferred to the next plant that the insect feeds on. However, in order for cauliflower mosaic virus particles to become attached to the aphid, structures called transmission bodies must form beforehand in the infected plant cells. These structures are known to contain helper proteins that bind the viruses to the mouth of the aphid, but the precise role of the transmission body has remained obscure.</p><p>Now Martini&#xe8;re et al. show that the transmission body is in fact a dynamic structure that reacts to the presence of aphids and, in so doing, boosts the efficiency of viral transmission. In particular, they show that the action of an aphid feeding on an infected leaf triggers a rapid and massive influx of a protein called tubulin into the transmission body. The transmission body then bursts open, dispersing helper protein-virus particle complexes throughout the cell, where they become more accessible to aphids. This series of events increases viral transmission rates twofold to threefold.</p><p>The results show that a virus can detect insect vectors, likely by using the sensory system of its host, and trigger a response that boosts viral uptake and thus transmission. This is a novel concept in virology. It will be important to discover whether similar mechanisms are used by other viruses, including those that infect animals and humans.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00183.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00183.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>aphids</kwd><kwd>transmission</kwd><kwd>cell&#x2013;virus&#x2013;vector interactions</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Arabidopsis</kwd><kwd>Viruses</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source>INRA, D&#xe9;partement SPE, France</funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Drucker</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source>Agence National de Recherche (ANR), France</funding-source><award-id>BLAN07-2-192768</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blanc</surname><given-names>St&#xe9;phane</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>1.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cauliflower mosaic virus reacts immediately when aphids feed on the host plant, and this boosts its chances of being taken up and transmitted by the insects to a new plant.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transmission is a pivotal step in the infection cycle of viruses: it controls the passage from one host to another and is thus essential for dissemination. This step can represent a significant bottleneck for the infection cycle, since it is common for only a small proportion of the countless viral genomes produced to be passed on to a new host in a transmission event; for example, only one to three of the many transmissible genomes initiate a new infection after <italic>Potato virus Y</italic> transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Moury et al., 2007</xref>). It is thus expected that viruses have adapted their life cycle and developed sophisticated strategies to optimize their transmission. Whereas non-viral pathogens are known to allocate resources for the production of transmission-specific morphs (discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Matthews, 2011</xref>), surprisingly little is known for this mechanism regarding viruses (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blanc et al., 2011</xref>). Some viruses are transmitted vertically to host offspring and others are transmitted by contact between hosts (e.g., by wind, water or physical contact), but most viruses rely on vectors for rapid proliferation within host populations (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kuno and Chang, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blanc et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bak et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The most important vectors are found among the arthropods. Those with a piercing-sucking feeding behavior such as mosquitoes (or other blood-feeding dipterans) and ticks are especially significant for vertebrate viruses, and likewise aphids, white flies and other sap-feeding bugs are consequential for plant viruses. These vectors are ideal, as their variety of mouth parts can puncture cells, blood vessels, and plant sap vessels with great precision, thus enabling efficient uptake and injection of pathogens without killing the host. Vector transmission can be classified into two main transmission modes. In circulative transmission, the virus is taken up by the vector together with the nutrients (e.g., blood, plant sap, cell contents), where it actively crosses from the intestine into the vector interior. Then it cycles through the hemocoel (the internal body cavity awash in hemolymph) to the salivary glands, where the virus can be secreted together with the saliva into a new host. The second transmission mode is alternatively referred to as mechanical transmission (for human and animal viruses) or non-circulative transmission (for plant viruses). In this transmission mode, the arthropod vector only briefly comes into contact with the virus, in which it transiently attaches to the vector mouth parts and is subsequently released; an internalization step does not occur. The viral proteins involved in this seemingly simple process have been well-described in the literature, often down to the molecular level (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ng and Falk, 2006</xref>). On the other hand, their precise roles during virus-acquisition by the vector remains largely unexplored (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blanc et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p><italic>Cauliflower mosaic virus</italic> (CaMV), the virus studied here, is a non-circulative virus transmitted by aphids. CaMV binds to a receptor protein located at the tip of the aphid&#x27;s needle-like mouth parts, the stylets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Uzest et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2010</xref>). The CaMV transmissible complex is composed of the icosahedral viral particle (containing the viral genome enclosed by a shell of capsid protein P4), the virus-associated protein P3, and finally the aphid-transmission factor or helper component, the viral protein P2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blanc et al., 1993a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leh et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Plisson et al., 2005</xref>). P2 is central to the virus&#x27;s transmission, as it links the virus particle to the aphid stylets through the interaction of its C-terminus with virus-associated P3, as well as the linking of its N-terminus with the stylet receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Interestingly, although P2 deletion mutants of CaMV are not transmissible by aphids, they are perfectly infectious when inoculated artificially to host plants. This shows that the only role for P2 in the CaMV life cycle is virus&#x2013;vector interaction. P2 localizes exclusively to a specific cytoplasmic inclusion in infected plant cells, the transmission body (TB, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). There, P2 co-aggregates with the viral protein P3 to form a matrix in which some virus particles are embedded; the existence of any cellular components within this matrix remains elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Espinoza et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Drucker et al., 2002</xref>). The TB-contained P3 is most likely dissimilar in conformation to the P3 associated with the virus particle, and has been suggested to play a role in TB structure and maintenance, but any details are yet unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Drucker et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hoh et al., 2010</xref>). TBs are indispensable to this transmission, as it has previously been shown that aphids are unable to acquire the virus in their absence (i.e., P2 deletion mutants, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Woolston et al., 1983</xref>), as well as when TBs are malformed. The P2 mutant, P2<sub>G94R</sub> (described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Khelifa et al., 2007</xref>), assists efficiently in the transmission of purified CaMV particles associated with P3, when aphids are allowed to acquire all three components in vitro from suspensions across Parafilm membranes. However, when the P2<sub>G94R</sub> mutant is expressed <italic>in planta</italic> in the context of CaMV infection, it induces the formation of a misshaped TB (for details see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Khelifa et al., 2007</xref>), preventing plant-to-plant transmission by the aphid vector.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00183.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The CaMV transmissible complex and the transmission body.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left: the CaMV transmissible complex comprises the virus particle, composed of capsid protein P4 (yellow), virus-associated protein P3 (blue) and the helper component P2 (red). P2 binds via its C-terminus to P3 and via its N-terminus to a protein receptor localized in the stylet tips of the aphid vector (middle and right). (<bold>B</bold>) Infected cells contain many cytoplasmic virus factories (VF), where most virus particles (blue-yellow circles) accumulate in a matrix composed of virus protein P6 (grey), and a single transmission body (TB). The TB (also cytoplasmic) is composed of P2 (red) and P3 (blue) as well as scattered virus particles. P3 in TBs is most likely in a conformation that differs from virus-associated P3. The spatial separation of the components of the transmissible complex (P2 in the TB and most virus particles in VFs) lead us to propose that they unite only at the moment of vector acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Drucker et al., 2002</xref>).

Aphids feeding on plant leaves insert their stylets into the middle lamella that separates adjacent cells, and subsequently perform a series of brief test punctures into the epidermis and parenchyma cells; this continues until eventually reaching the phloem where they can feed for long periods, provided the plant is a suitable host (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fereres and Moreno, 2009</xref>). Most plant cells survive the initial test punctures, during which only minute amounts of cytoplasm are ingested. CaMV and hundreds of other viral species can be acquired during this feeding behavior, but detailed events occurring within the punctured cell at the precise moment of stylet entry and how they result in virus acquisition are largely unknown. In the example of CaMV, it is known that microtubules are involved in the generation of TBs at the onset of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Martini&#xe8;re et al., 2009</xref>) and that the microtubule depolymerizing drug oryzalin inhibits virus acquisition by aphids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Martini&#xe8;re et al., 2011a</xref>), but any details of the mode of action of oryzalin on TBs and how TBs function in virus transmission are still unclear.</p><p>Here, we have analyzed the three-way interaction between CaMV, host plant cell, and aphid at the precise moment of the intracellular penetration of the stylets and imminent virus acquisition. Our study reveals an unforeseen capability of CaMV in that it senses&#x2014;probably by using the host cell machinery&#x2014;the aphid feeding, and then instantly produces a transmissible form for uptake by the insect.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Different TB forms are detected in infected plant cells</title><p>At the beginning of this study was the observation that several different TB phenotypes could be discerned in infected tissues, as viewed by double-labeling experiments using antibodies against the TB marker P2 and the microtubule protein &#x3b1;-tubulin. Thus, typical TBs were detected, and these were rather large (2&#x2013;5 &#x3bc;m in diameter) and mostly ovoid single cytoplasmic inclusions, having a cortex heavily labeled by P2 antibody and a less intensely labeled interior. Most importantly, little if any tubulin was detected in this regular form of the TB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Interestingly, we also observed a second class of TBs that was phenotypically nearly identical, with the exception that tubulin had greatly accumulated in their centers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Even more surprisingly, we were unable to detect TBs in some cells; at best, small P2 foci without the typical TB structure were visible (hereafter referred to as fragmented TBs). Instead, most P2 decorated the microtubule network in these cells (a P2 distribution pattern hereafter designated as &#x2018;mixed-networks&#x2019; and referring to mixed P2-tubulin networks; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). A common point among these three TB phenotypes was that their occurrence varied greatly from one experiment to the next. Depending on the tissue preparation, anywhere from almost none to practically all of the TBs contained tubulin; the proportion of cells containing mixed-networks also varied from one experiment to another. To account for these observations, we hypothesized that, among the different TB morphologies observed (hereafter referred to as &#x2018;morphs&#x2019;), the tubulin-loaded (Tub<sup>&#x2b;</sup>&#x7c;TB) and mixed-network phenotypes were induced by unidentified stresses during leaf handling, whereas the tubulin-less phenotype (Tub<sup>&#x2212;</sup>&#x7c;TBs) corresponded to unstressed &#x2018;standby&#x2019; TBs found under normal conditions. As the only known role for TBs is in transmission, this further raised the question of whether and how the presence of tubulin within TBs impacts transmission by aphids. To investigate this phenomenon, we first aimed to identify artificial stresses that could trigger specific transformation of standby TBs into Tub<sup>&#x2b;</sup>&#x7c;TBs and mixed-networks. Heat-shock, wounding and CO<sub>2</sub> exposure all induced TB transformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D&#x2013;F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2&#x2014;figure supplement 1</xref>). Quantification of the various TB morphs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) established that all three treatments induced Tub<sup>&#x2b;</sup>&#x7c;TBs. However, mixed-networks (co-existing with Tub<sup>&#x2b;</sup>&#x7c;TBs and fragmented TBs) were significantly increased only in wounded or CO<sub>2</sub>-exposed leaves, and were rarely observed in heat-shocked or untreated leaves. This indicates that the different stresses had different and specific effects on TBs.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00183.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Stress induces different TB morphs.</title><p> (<bold>A</bold>&#x2013;<bold>C</bold>) The three TB morphs.

The line scans show that the TB in (<bold>A</bold>) contains hardly any tubulin, whereas the TB in (<bold>B</bold>) is heavily tubulin-labeled, revealing stronger tubulin labeling in the center of the TB than at the cortex. Finally, the distributions of P2 and tubulin labels colocalize in the mixed-networks shown in (<bold>C</bold>). The intensities are indicated in arbitrary units (AU) since the acquisition conditions were not identical for the different samples. (<bold>D</bold>&#x2013;<bold>F</bold>) Stress induces TB transformation. Immunofluorescence labeling (P2 in red, tubulin in green, DAPI nucleic acid stain in blue) of infected leaves after the indicated stress treatment shows that heat shock (<bold>D</bold>) induces only Tub<sup>&#x2b;</sup>&#x7c;TBs, whereas wounding stress (<bold>E</bold>) and exposure to CO<sub>2</sub> (<bold>F</bold>) additionally induce TB fragmentation (as revealed by the small red or orange foci in <bold>E</bold> and <bold>F</bold>) and mixed-networks.

Here, we pursued three complementary objectives: i) to characterize the dynamics of TB transformation; ii) to investigate whether aphid feeding activity can trigger this transformation; and iii) to test whether TB transformation is required for successful CaMV transmission.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>TB dynamics occur on a fast time scale</title><p>For TB changes to have any biological relevance in CaMV acquisition by aphid vectors, they must happen fast enough to be compatible with the duration of the intracellular penetration of the aphid stylets during test probes, that is, within &#x223c;10 s. To estimate the speed of TB transformation, we first tested wounding stress by inflicting cuts with a razor blade on infected turnip leaves. The tissue was then fixed immediately (&#x223c;10 s) and the TB phenotype analyzed by immunofluorescence. Tub<sup>&#x2b;</sup>&#x7c;TBs and mixed-networks were detected readily at the wounding sites; by contrast, the cells of control tissue, or tissue wounded after fixation, predominantly harbored standby TBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We next evaluated the kinetics of tubulin entry into TBs. The surface of a CaMV-infected Arabidopsis leaf expressing genetically tagged GFP-tubulin (<italic>GFP-TUA6</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ueda et al., 1999</xref>) was touched with a microelectrode, and the response of TBs in epidermis cells was recorded using confocal time-lapse macroscopy. In the event of a fast entry of tubulin into TB, we should expect to observe a rapid appearance of fluorescent foci, corresponding to Tub<sup>&#x2b;</sup>&#x7c;TBs within these cells. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="movie" rid="movie1">Movie 1</xref> reveal the detection of GFP-tubulin in TBs as early as &#x223c;5 s after microelectrode impact; fluorescence in these inclusions reached a maximum and stabilized within &#x223c;10 s. Similar results were obtained in &#x223c;50% of all infected cells tested (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Contrarily, GFP-tubulin formed a diffuse fluorescent cloud at the impact site in healthy control cells, in line with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hardham et al., 2008</xref>); fast appearance of tubulin inclusions as in infected cells was never observed. Subsequently, we examined whether the tubulin within TBs is exchanged with that of the cytoplasm, by measuring GFP-tubulin turnover in Tub<sup>&#x2b;</sup>&#x7c;TBs in fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments (FRAP). Photo-bleached GFP-tubulin in TBs was rapidly replaced by fresh cytoplasmic GFP-tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B&#x2013;D</xref>), suggesting that this protein circulates continuously between Tub<sup>&#x2b;</sup>&#x7c;TB and the cytoplasm. Taken together, these results indicate that the appearance of both Tub<sup>&#x2b;</sup>&#x7c;TBs and mixed-networks is fast enough to occur during an aphid puncture, and that there is a dynamic equilibrium between cytosolic and TB-contained tubulin.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00183.014</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Tubulin influx into TBs occurs on a rapid time scale.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Kinetics of tubulin entry into TBs.

The fluorescence levels were normalized (100% &#x3d; fluorescence before bleaching, 0% &#x3d; fluorescence just after bleaching). For the two quantification graphs, FRAP trend lines (red) were calculated from seven FRAP experiments on GFP-tubulin-containing TBs, or from 18 FRAP experiments on cytoplasmic zones. The difference in t<sub>(1/2)</sub> for fluorescence recovery between TBs and the cytoplasm was highly significant (p&#x3c;0.0001, t-test with n &#x3d; 18 for TBs and n &#x3d; 21 for cytoplasm). In contrast, the difference in the mobile fractions, that is, the percentage of exchangeable GFP-tubulin, the so-called mobile fraction, was not significant (p&#x3d;0.504, t-test with n &#x3d; 18 for TBs and n &#x3d; 21 for cytoplasm). These results indicate that tubulin cycles between the cytoplasm and TBs, albeit at much slower rates than free diffusion in the cytoplasm.

To facilitate tracking, we used infected protoplasts to screen for various conditions that could induce TB transformation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), including various physical, chemical and biological stresses. These wide-ranging cell treatments showed that of all the tested stresses, only heat, the chemical sodium azide, compacting of cells by sedimentation and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) induced TB transformation. As in leaves, heat treatment of protoplasts only induced Tub<sup>&#x2b;</sup>&#x7c;TBs (data not shown), whereas CO<sub>2</sub> and azide stimulated Tub<sup>&#x2b;</sup>&#x7c;TBs as well as mixed-networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>).

After 5 min (CO<sub>2</sub> treatment) or 40 min (azide treatment) most cells displayed mixed-networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>).

Are virus particles, the other major component of the CaMV transmissible complex, also distributed onto the mixed-networks? To answer this question, we carried out immunofluorescence of the mixed-networks using a CaMV capsid protein antibody. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> shows that capsid protein localizes to cytoplasmic inclusions (which are most likely virus factories) in unstressed cells. Under conditions that trigger the formation of the mixed-networks, that is, CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) or azide treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), P4 label colocalized with microtubules. Quantification of this observation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) indicates that almost all cells displayed P4 networks after stress treatment. Nearly the same proportion of cells contained P2 or P4 networks after treatment with CO<sub>2</sub> or azide (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>), which suggested that mixed-networks are also associated with virus particles. We confirmed this by electron- and immunogold microscopy, which showed (in treated cells) that cortical microtubules displaying P2 were indeed also decorated heavily with CaMV particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A&#x2013;C</xref>). Finally, we also examined the ultrastructure of standby and Tub<sup>&#x2b;</sup>&#x7c;TBs.

However, in all of the above cases, TB transformations were induced by artificial stresses and might not reflect a &#x2018;natural&#x2019; induction of TB changes in aphid-infested plants. We therefore aimed to determine whether aphid feeding activity by itself triggers TB transformation. Accordingly, we developed a protocol that simultaneously allows observation of the TB phenotype in infected cells and the discrimination of cells, based on whether or not they had been in direct contact with aphid stylets. For this procedure, aphids were allowed to feed on infected leaves for 15 min, before the leaf was fixed and subsequently screened by confocal microscopy. We then identified, by their auto-fluorescence, the salivary sheaths that remain in the tissue after aphid removal, and which precisely document the path followed by the stylets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Miles, 1968</xref>). In addition, we identified by immunofluorescence the different TB morphs in plant cells that were either in close contact or farther away from these sheaths. Standby TBs were predominantly detected in uninfested tissues, or in infested tissues greater than 15 &#x3bc;m from the stylet track (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). In contrast, cells of infested leaves within a 15 &#x3bc;m perimeter of salivary sheaths often displayed typical mixed-networks, fragmented TBs and Tub<sup>&#x2b;</sup>&#x7c;TBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B,C</xref>). Mixed-networks in cells close to the stylet track were also loaded with virus particles, as indicated by positive P4 capsid protein label of microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Quantification of the aphid-induced effect showed that 30&#x2013;40% of TBs in cells in contact with a stylet track displayed a modified TB phenotype, whereas 99% of TBs in cells found more than one cell layer away from this track remained in the standby state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). In parallel experiments, aphids were removed after the 15-min feeding period and the leaves were allowed to recover for 2 h before analysis. This intriguingly provoked the aphid-induced mixed-networks to revert back to standby TBs, as demonstrated by the strong decrease in the number of modified TBs close to the stylet tracks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). This resembled the reversion observed in protoplasts, upon relief from either azide or CO<sub>2</sub> treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>). Taken together, these results show that the probing activity of aphid stylets is a robust trigger of TB transformation, and that these aphid-induced TB changes are completely reversible.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00183.033</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Mixed-networks appear in tissue zones pierced by aphid stylets.</title><p> Unstressed CaMV-infected leaves (<bold>A</bold>) or leaves infested by aphids for 15 min (<bold>B</bold>&#x2013;<bold>D</bold>) were analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy.

We therefore investigated whether TB transformation is required for aphid-transmission of CaMV. Assessing the effect of TB transformation on transmission was however not straightforward, since aphids themselves provoke TB transformation. As a possible means to circumvent this problem, we observed while quantifying TB morphs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>) that only 30&#x2013;40% of the TBs had transformed after contact with the stylets. We thus reasoned that a pre-treatment of infected cells that would substantially increase the proportion of modified TBs prior to aphid feeding should &#x2018;prime&#x2019; these cells for virus acquisition and enhance the CaMV transmission rate. To investigate this, we first induced mixed-networks in protoplasts with azide, and then used the cells in aphid transmission experiments. We observed significantly elevated transmission rates compared to transmission from control cells that displayed mainly standby TBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). The effect was not caused by altered aphid behavior resulting from the presence of azide in the protoplast medium, because the chemical had no effect in transmission experiments in which aphids were allowed to acquire CaMV instead from cells from suspensions containing purified virus, recombinant P2 and P3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). Azide also had no effect on protoplast viability under the conditions used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). Taken together, these results rule out a possible confounding effect of azide, and clearly indicate that it was the presence of mixed-networks that lead to increased transmission rates. In order to compare this situation with that of intact plant tissues, we examined infected CO<sub>2</sub>-treated or heat-shocked leaves in transmission assays. Under heat shock treatment, TB transformation appeared incomplete and arrested at the Tub<sup>&#x2b;</sup>&#x7c;TB stage, as reported above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2&#x2014;figure supplement 1</xref>). The heat-shocked leaves did not perform any better than controls in aphid-transmission tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>), indicating that tubulin entry into TBs alone is not sufficient to enhance transmission. In contrast, CO<sub>2</sub> induced complete TB transformation into mixed-networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Moreover, significantly enhanced transmission rates were recorded when CO<sub>2</sub>-treated leaves were used in aphid transmission experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>).<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00183.038</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>TB transformation correlates with enhanced transmission efficiency.</title><p> (<bold>A</bold>) Azide enhances transmission from protoplasts.

Furthermore, we hypothesize that the higher accessibility of CaMV to its aphid vector can be explained by microtubules serving as a scaffold for the rapid redistribution of P2 and virus particles over the entire cell. If this were true, then depolymerization of microtubules by oryzalin should both prevent the formation of mixed-networks, and significantly decrease the transmission rate. We have previously shown that oryzalin diminishes transmission from infected protoplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Martini&#xe8;re et al., 2011a</xref>). Consistent with these results, we show here that oryzalin induces Tub<sup>&#x2b;</sup>&#x7c;TBs within 15 min, but prevents mixed-network formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F,G</xref>).</p><p>To further confirm the role of TB changes in aphid-transmission of CaMV, we pursued an independent approach and examined a CaMV mutant impaired in transmission. This mutant, CaMV P2-TC, harbors a 7-amino acid insertion, including a tetracysteine tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Griffin et al., 1998</xref>) at position 100 of the P2 protein. The mutant virus was fully infectious as compared to wild type virus; furthermore, the P2-TC protein as well as viral proteins P3, P4 and P6 accumulated to similar levels in infected plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). However, in comparison to wild type TBs, this mutant induced TBs (TB-TCs) that seemed to be smaller, with a more regular rounded shape, and a more pronounced P2-rich cortex, as revealed by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). Heat shock induced an influx of tubulin into TB-TCs, and photobleached GFP-tubulin contained in TB-TC was observed to be exchanged with cytoplasmic tubulin in FRAP experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>), although the kinetics differed from tubulin replacement in wild type TBs (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Thus the TB of the P2-TC mutant bears some similarity to wild type TB. Nevertheless, CaMV P2-TC was completely non-transmissible in plant-to-plant transmission experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>). This could be due to a defect of TB-TC in undergoing correct transformation upon aphid puncture; an alternative is that this is due to a lack of interaction between the mutant P2-TC protein and either virus particles or aphid stylets. To distinguish between these possibilities, we first tested whether P2-TC protein can mediate the binding of virus particles to the aphid stylets. One way to test this is to allow aphids to feed on suspensions containing recombinant P2-TC, P3 and purified virus particles through membranes, before they are transferred to test plants for inoculation. Binding of transmissible complexes acquired by the aphids from the feeding solution is then scored by counting the number of successful transmission events, that is, the number of infected test plants. Although the transmission rates were significantly lower than that obtained with wild type P2, the P2-TC mutant protein was indeed active in such assays, retaining around 50% of the wild P2 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref>). We thus reasoned that defects in P2-TC binding to virus particles or stylets can only partially explain the complete failure in plant-to-plant transmission of the P2-TC mutant, and that a failure in TB-TC transformation may also be involved. To investigate this possibility, we allowed aphids to infest CaMV-P2TC-infected leaves for 15 min. The leaves were then processed for immunofluorescence against P2 and &#x3b1;-tubulin, and scored for the TB phenotype in cells found close to and farther away from the salivary sheaths. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10F,G</xref> demonstrates that only standby TBs were detected, and not Tub<sup>&#x2b;</sup>&#x7c;TBs or mixed-networks. This result is further evidence for a strong positive correlation between the appearance of mixed-networks (i.e., TB transformation) and successful aphid transmission, and presents direct biological evidence in support of our transmission hypothesis.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00183.049</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>The P2-TC mutant of CaMV is inactive in plant-to-plant transmission.</title><p> (<bold>A</bold>) Accumulation of viral proteins in CaMV P2-TC-infected plants.

The graph shows recovery kinetics from t &#x3d; 0 s (time point of photobleach) onwards. The fluorescence levels were normalized (100% &#x3d; fluorescence before bleaching, 0% &#x3d; fluorescence just after bleaching). The red trend line was calculated from nine experiments.

Compared to wild type TBs, the t<sub>(1/2)</sub> for fluorescence recovery was significantly slower (p&#x3c;0.0001, t-test with n &#x3d; 21 for wild type TBs and n &#x3d; 23 for TC-TBs) and the proportion of the mobile fraction was significantly higher in P2-TC TBs (p&#x3d;0.0001, t-test with n &#x3d; 21 for wild type TBs and n &#x3d; 23 for TC-TBs).

Pooled data are shown from two independent experiments using 12 different leaves for each condition. No statistical analysis was performed, as the effect of the P2-TC mutant on plant-to-plant transmission was total (no transmission from P2-TC-infected plants was observed).

The histogram shows that P2-TC supported aphid transmission of CaMV under these conditions, although this was significantly reduced as compared to the wild type P2 (p&#x3d;0.02, n &#x3d; 8 from two independent experiments, Mann&#x2013;Whitney test).

Transmission is controlled by the different TB morphs. The tubulin-less TB found in normal &#x2018;unstressed&#x2019; cells has been well-described over the past several decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shalla et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rodriguez et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Espinoza et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blanc et al., 1993b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Drucker et al., 2002</xref>), and here functions as a standby TB that &#x2018;anticipates&#x2019; the vector arrival. Then, when aphids land on the plant and insert their stylets into tissues, CaMV uses the plant&#x27;s response during stylet entry to its advantage at a very early stage of the plant&#x2013;aphid interaction. This results in TBs that undergo dramatic, short-lived changes leading to the temporary redistribution of P2 and virus onto microtubules. These hitherto overlooked TB alterations result in a reversible TB &#x2018;activation&#x2019; that optimizes virus acquisition. The activation or increased transmission efficiency is probably due to the mixed-networks distributing P2 and virus homogeneously on microtubules throughout the cell periphery. This could in turn facilitate virus acquisition: in this new configuration, P2 and the virus are more accessible to the vector during its random punctures, as compared to the remote localization of P2 in isolated TBs. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that inhibition of mixed-network formation, either in the CaMV-P2TC mutant or pharmacologically by oryzalin, resulted in decreased transmission. The converse situation also applies, as artificial induction of mixed-networks by CO<sub>2</sub> and azide were correlated strongly with increased transmission rates. These results additionally indicate that the TB reaction is required for transmission.<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00183.056</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><p>Model of CaMV acquisition. (<bold>A</bold>) In an infected cell in the &#x2018;standby&#x2019; state, there are numerous virus factories (VF) containing most of the replicated virus particles (yellow-blue circles), enclosed within a matrix of viral protein P6 (grey). This is accompanied in the cell by a mostly single transmission body (TB), composed of a matrix containing all of the cell&#x27;s P2 (red), co-aggregated with P3 (blue) and some virus particles. Microtubules are represented in green. (<bold>B</bold>) An aphid landing on an infected plant inserts its stylets into a cell to test the plant. This causes a mechanical stress (stylet movement) and/or a chemical stress (e.g., elicited by saliva components). This stress, symbolized by the yellow flashes, is immediately perceived by the plant and can induce subsequent defense responses. The initial aphid recognition signal is transduced simultaneously in a TB response, characterized by an influx of tubulin (green) into the TB. (<bold>C</bold>) In a second step, the TB disintegrates rapidly (within seconds), and all the P2 as well as some virus particles relocalize on the cortical microtubules as mixed-networks. Whether or not the virus particles originate at the VFs, as presented here, is unknown. Transmissible P2-virus complexes are now homogeneously distributed throughout the cell periphery, which significantly increases the chances of successful binding of P2 and virus to the stylets and thus transmission. (<bold>D</bold>) After departure of the aphid vector (here loaded with P2 and virus), a new TB is reformed from the mixed-networks and is ready for another round of transmission.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00183.056">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00183.056</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="elife00183f011"/></fig></p><p>One enduring question that deserves further attention is precisely where the virus particles come from that are recruited onto the microtubules. Whereas the origin of microtubule-associated P2 is clearly the TB (since the TB is the only source of P2), the origin of the virus particles aligning on the microtubules is less clear. They could derive either from the TB, which contains some virus particles, or from the many virus factories dispersed throughout the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Espinoza et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Drucker et al., 2002</xref>). We were also intrigued to observe that only certain stresses&#x2014;notably aphid feeding activity, wounding, azide and CO<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;could trigger TB transformation. This reveals a certain level of specificity in TB activation, although it is more broad than the classical pattern recognition receptor-mediated defense responses of plants against pathogens (including insects) that are often species or even isolate-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hogenhout and Bos, 2011</xref>). This broad specificity is not surprising, since CaMV is transmitted by at least 30 different aphid species. Importantly, this suggests that the plant responses against aphids (that are probably exploited by CaMV for the TB reaction) are triggered by an elicitor common to all aphids. Whether this elicitor triggers an innate plant immunity pathway or a separate perception/reaction cascade remains an open question.</p><p>The significance of this remarkable phenomenon described here extends beyond CaMV transmission to broader fields of research. First, this opens up a fascinating new direction within virology, to explore whether other viruses form transmission morphs in response to vector-sensing by the host. Second, the transient accumulation of tubulin in TBs, followed by redistribution of TB contents on microtubules uncovers unforeseen capacities of tubulin/microtubule dynamics and raises further questions pertinent to cell biology. For example: How can apparently soluble tubulin concentrate in the TB and what is its function there? Does this serve as the source for the mixed-networks? Most strikingly, our work reveals that a virus can detect external stresses (probably by using its host&#x27;s perception system) and respond in a way that is somewhat independent of the host&#x27;s response. We propose naming this phenomenon: &#x2018;virus perceptive behavior&#x2019;. This concept is nicely illustrated by three compelling observations made in this study. First, TB transformation occurs while the host plant is still in the process of transducing the triggering signal. This shows that the virus appropriates the host&#x27;s perception machinery itself, rather than relying upon downstream reactions that take tens of minutes (or hours) to manifest and establish local and systemic defense responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ku&#x15b;nierczyk et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Vos and Jander, 2010</xref>). Second, after transformation of the TB into mixed-networks, the fate of CaMV appears disconnected from the final host response. Indeed, within the time frame required for the host plant to respond to an aphid attack, mixed-networks have already served as a robust virus source for aphids, and have long since reverted back to standby TBs. Third, the response mechanisms themselves are also entirely different from the reported plant physiological responses to aphid attack. These include callose deposition near the salivary sheaths and within sieve tubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Villada et al., 2009</xref>), changes in gene expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ku&#x15b;nierczyk et al., 2008</xref>), altered emission of volatile compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Vos and Jander, 2010</xref>); and the initiation of salicylic, abscisic, and jasmonic acid systemic defense pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Giovanini et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ku&#x15b;nierczyk et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">de Vos and Jander, 2009</xref>). In contrast, the TB response seems to be restricted to a CaMV-specific and immediate diversion of tubulin/microtubules (plus putative unknown associated partners) for virus transmission, in a manner unlike anything described before.</p><p>Whether such viral perceptive behaviors play a role in the vector-transmission of other viruses is entirely unknown, and will thus be a question of great priority in the field of research on virus transmission. Viruses tightly regulate all the different steps of their life cycle, from intracellular replication and short- and long-distance intra-host movement, to inter-host spread. In this sense, the ability to specifically trigger the &#x2018;transmission-mode&#x2019; at the right time and the right place seems like a valuable adaptation for avoiding the deleterious interference between these various functions.</p><p>On a more broad scope, our results highlight many unexpected research horizons to explore in the biology of these fascinating pathogens. The possible instances in which viruses could react directly to cues from the host environment, the diversity of sensorial pathways that could be exploited in both animal and plant hosts, and the number of key life cycle steps that could be optimized accordingly all inspire questions that will shape future research directions in this field. Finally, aside from being an academic challenge, this phenomenon also represents a potential Achilles heel in viral transmission that could lead to novel virus control strategies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plants, viruses and inoculation</title><p>Turnip plants (<italic>Brassica rapa</italic> cv. &#x2018;Just Right&#x2019;) and transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> Col0 plants with a <italic>gl1</italic> marker expressing GFP-TUA6 under control of the 35S promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ueda et al., 1999</xref>) were alternatively used as CaMV hosts, depending on the experiment.

Leaf samples were mounted in 1% low melting point agar to prevent focus shift. Twenty scans of the entire field of view were made at pre-bleach intensity, and then a circular 20 &#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup> region of interest (ROI), which included a TB, was photobleached. Three iterations of the 488-nm laser at 100% intensity were used for the bleaching. For recovery of the fluorescence in TBs, images were recorded for 110 s, with a 512 &#xd7; 512 px picture size, a scan speed of 167 ms/frame and a delay between frames of 0.2 s. For controls, to account for fast tubulin diffusion in the cytosol, recovery was recorded in identical ROIs for only 5.9 s, with a 100 &#xd7; 50 px picture size, a scan speed of 16 ms/frame and a delay between frames of 23 ms. We verified that the energy of the 488-nm laser used for the post-bleach added no bleaching effect by recording a control region outside the bleaching ROI. The experiment was repeated 21 times for wild type TB bleaching, 23 times for TB-TC bleaching and 18 times in the case of cytoplasmic soluble tubulin.

Your article has been evaluated by a Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and 2 reviewers. The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission want to reveal their identity: Thorsten N&#xfc;rnberger (BRE); Georg Jander (peer reviewer); Saskia Hogenhout (peer reviewer).</p><p>The reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision. Our goal is to provide the essential revision requirements as a single set of instructions, so that you have a clear view of the revisions that are necessary for us to publish your work.</p><p>The discovery that aphid feeding and other stresses can trigger a tubulin-dependent reorganization of transmission bodies in plant cells infected with CaMV, that this reorganization depends on viral protein P2, and that the &#x201c;mixed networks&#x201d; mediate viral transmission are original and significant contributions and highly appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic>. However, <italic>eLife</italic> is a broad audience journal and it is critical that the manuscript is written in a manner that will be accessible to its readership. Accordingly:</p><p>1. The manuscript should be re-written to provide background information and to improve the writing. Special attention should be given to the Introduction and Results section &#x2018;TB transformation enables efficient transmission&#x2019;.

Label the figures in a manner that is more intuitive with each micrograph separately labeled and provide clear explanations for some of the figures.

We would ask you to re-phrase the title and abstract of your study. In our view, this is mandatory as it indicates that viruses indeed make use of the host machinery for vector-mediated transmission.

Consider obtaining detailed feedback from a colleague who is not in the plant virus field</italic>.</p><p>We took great care to present our results in a way appropriate for a broad audience. Many parts of the manuscript were rewritten (especially the Introduction, the Results section, and the figure legends). The text was edited for language and readability by a native English-speaking biologist not from the plant virus field. We hope that the text is now easier to understand.</p><p><italic>2.

This was a cool idea because the profiles show clearly the differential distribution of P2 within a TB (TB cortex with strong P2 label and center region with weaker P2 label and the opposite for the a-tubulin label). The text was adapted accordingly.</p><p><italic>3. Label the figures in a manner that is more intuitive with each micrograph separately labeled and provide clear explanations for some of the figures. Specifically, the graphs in Figure 3B need to be explained, Figures 2, 3, 4, and 5K need improved labeling, and Figure 6C was difficult to interpret</italic>.</p><p>The original 6 figures were split up into 11 newly designed figures.

We would ask you to re-phrase the title and abstract of your study. In our view, this is mandatory as it indicates that viruses indeed make use of the host machinery for vector-mediated transmission. While this hypothesis seems plausible, it was not investigated in your study to an extent that would justify this rather strong statement</italic>.</p><p>To take account of your remarks on the title, we changed it to &#x201c;Looking outside: A virus responds instantly to the presence of the vector on the host and forms transmission morphs&#x201d;. We believe that this title better reflects our work and is less speculative. If you have any suggestions for alternative titles, we will be happy to consider them. The Abstract, the Digest and the impact statement were also changed to respect the fact that, although the results suggest it, we do not directly prove viral use of the host sensory system.</p></body></sub-article></article>
