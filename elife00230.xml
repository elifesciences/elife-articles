However, understanding patterning in natural communities is hampered by the multitude of cell&#x2013;cell and cell&#x2013;environment interactions as well as environmental variability. Here, through simulations and experiments on communities in defined environments, we examined how ecological interactions between two distinct partners impacted community patterning. We found that in strong cooperation with spatially localized large fitness benefits to both partners, a unique pattern is generated: partners spatially intermixed by appearing successively on top of each other, insensitive to initial conditions and interaction dynamics. Intermixing was experimentally observed in two obligatory cooperative systems: an engineered yeast community cooperating through metabolite-exchanges and a methane-producing community cooperating through redox-coupling. Even in simulated communities consisting of several species, most of the strongly-cooperating pairs appeared intermixed. Thus, when ecological interactions are the major patterning force, strong cooperation leads to partner intermixing.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00230.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00230.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00230.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Microorganisms such as bacteria, archaea and tiny eukaryotes are found throughout the biosphere. Some of these microorganisms are pathogens that cause diseases in animals, while others provide nutrients, including essential amino acids and vitamins; there are also microorganisms that have critical roles in recycling elements such as carbon, nitrogen and oxygen in the biosphere. In the natural world, microorganisms interact with their environment and with each other, often competing for space, light and nutrients, but sometimes they act cooperatively, which benefits all parties involved.</p><p>Microbial communities exhibit spatial patterns that reflect the relative positioning of different microbes in a community. These patterns can be critical for the proper functioning of a microbial community. For example, in the microbial granules that digest organic compounds in waste water, the stratified pattern of different microbial species can be thought of as a sequence of catalysts needed to perform a series of biochemical processing steps. Thus, it is important to understand the mechanisms that drive pattern formation in multispecies communities.</p><p>Now, through a combination of simulations and experiments, Momeni et al. have identified two features of spatial patterns in two-population microbial communities when pattern formation is driven by fitness effects related to the ecological interactions between cells. First, interactions that confer significant advantages to at least one of the populations can potentially result in the generation of a stable community; the community is stable in the sense that if it is disturbed, it will return to its stable population composition following the disturbance. Indeed, in engineered <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> communities, very different initial population ratios converged to the same value over time when one strain depended on the other strain, or when the two strains depended on each other, but not when the two strains competed.</p><p>The second feature applies to microbial communities composed of two cooperating populations: whereas two populations that compete with each other tend to segregate, cooperation results in the members of the two populations mixing together. Momeni et al. observe the formation of such an &#x201c;intermixed&#x201d; community in simulations, and also in two experimental systems that involve cooperation&#x2014;a community containing two different strains of yeast cooperating through metabolite exchange, and a biofilm in which <italic>Methanococcus maripaludis</italic>, an archaeon that produces methane, cooperates with the bacterium <italic>Desulfovibrio vulgaris</italic>.</p><p>These two features of spatial patterning are conceptually similar to the competitive exclusion principle, which states that two species competing for the same resources cannot stably coexist if competition is the sole force at work. This principle has, therefore, encouraged scientists to search for the other forces that must be responsible for the coexistence of different species. Similarly, by predicting the sorts of patterns that will form when the fitness effects of ecological interactions between cells are the only forces at work, Momeni et al. lay the groundwork for investigations into other mechanisms, such as cell&#x2013;environment interactions and active cell motility, that can govern pattern formation in microbial communities.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00230.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00230.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>pattern formation</kwd><kwd>microbial communities</kwd><kwd>cooperation</kwd><kwd>ecological interactions</kwd><kwd>methanogenic biofilms</kwd><kwd>syntrophic biofilms</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research-organism</title><kwd>S. cerevisiae</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source>Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation</funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Momeni</surname><given-names>Babak</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source>Life Science Research Foundation</funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Momeni</surname><given-names>Babak</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source>National Science Foundation</funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brileya</surname><given-names>Kristen A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source>United States Department of Energy</funding-source><award-id>DE-AC02-05CH11231</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brileya</surname><given-names>Kristen A</given-names></name><name><surname>Fields</surname><given-names>Matthew W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source>National Institutes of Health</funding-source><award-id>DP2 OD006498-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Momeni</surname><given-names>Babak</given-names></name><name><surname>Shou</surname><given-names>Wenying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source>W.

Patterning, reflecting the relative spatial positioning of individuals with respect to each other, can be critical for the proper functioning of a community. Consider microbial communities: in a synthetic community, three bacterial species, each contributing an essential benefit while simultaneously competing for these benefits, can only grow when they are separated by an intermediate distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2008</xref>); different types of patterning are correlated with different levels of biofilm growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Christensen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brenner and Arnold, 2011</xref>); branching colony morphology allows more effective spreading across a nutrient-poor surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Levine and Ben-Jacob, 2004</xref>); and in waste treatment granules, the layered pattern of bacteria and archaea is thought to facilitate the sequential degradation of substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Satoh et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Despite the wide-ranging importance of microbial communities in, for example, human health and the biogeochemical cycling of elements, it is still unclear how cell&#x2013;cell and cell&#x2013;environment interactions govern the patterning of communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Elias and Banin, 2012</xref>). Understanding the mechanistic basis of pattern formation from observations of natural communities is stymied by the multitude of cell&#x2013;cell and cell&#x2013;environment interactions, as well as environmental variations within and across communities. Thus, it is not uncommon to observe qualitatively different patterns in samples of essentially the same type of community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Christensen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wilmes et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dekas et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>To circumvent the lack of control in natural communities, we employed mathematical and experimental systems to systematically investigate how different types of ecological interactions might lead to distinct community patterning. Interactions can be classified into different ecological types based on their fitness effects on the interacting partners. We focused on the fitness effects rather than the molecular mechanisms of interactions, because diverse molecular mechanisms, ranging from physical associations in cell coaggregates and biofilms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kolenbrander et al., 2010</xref>) to chemical interactions such as quorum sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Parsek and Greenberg, 2005</xref>), toxin warfare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vetsigian et al., 2011</xref>), and metabolite supply (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Christensen et al., 2002</xref>), all have fitness consequences which can be positive, neutral, or negative. Among different ecological interactions, we have placed a special emphasis on strong cooperation, interactions with large positive fitness effects on both partners including obligatory cooperation. This is because 1) it is important in a wide variety of microbial communities ranging from syntrophic systems critical for nutrient cycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schink, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Falkowski et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McInerney et al., 2009</xref>) to pathogenic biofilms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kelly, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kolenbrander et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Elias and Banin, 2012</xref>); and 2) the codependence between cooperative partners poses special challenges for isolating and culturing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schink, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McInerney et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>We investigated patterning in three-dimensional communities grown from two fluorescently-marked populations of cells initially randomly distributed on top of a surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Starting with a generalized model based on fitness effects of ecological interactions between two populations (A and B) occurring at a local scale (&#x2018;fitness model&#x2019;), we predicted: 1) interactions benefiting at least one partner could potentially allow initially disparate partner ratios to converge over time, and 2) unlike other types of ecological interactions that caused partner segregation or layering of one population over the other (A over B or B over A), strongly cooperating partners intermixed by forming patches that successively accumulated on top of each other (A over B over A over B, etc). We tested these predictions experimentally in obligatory cooperative systems including engineered yeast communities and syntrophic methanogenic biofilms. Finally, we used the fitness model to show &#x2018;strongly cooperating partners intermix&#x2019; could be generalized to communities consisting of multiple species.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00230.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The fitness model generates two ecological patterning predictions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In all simulated and experimental communities (see &#x2018;Materials and methods&#x2019;), two populations of cells, marked in red and green, were initially randomly distributed on a surface unless otherwise stated.

When the group of cells reached approximately 5-cell radius (c, hour 14), cells in the center could no longer push other cells to the side and instead budded upward, as indicated by higher intensities in the fluorescence images. Continued growth of microcolony forced more cells in the middle to send their progeny to upper layers, while cells close to the edge could still push other cells to the side and remained on the agarose surface (d, hour 17.5).

Cells along the path (yellow rim) to the nearest empty space shifted positions (left panel, cyan arrows) to accommodate the new cell.

Therefore, for simplicity, we use [&#x223c; &#x223c;] to denote the &#x2018;baseline&#x2019; competition. The fitness effect of baseline competition can start at zero if shared resources are in excess, but will eventually become negative as shared resources become limited. In &#x2018;addition&#x2019; to competition, interactions between two partners can exert positive, negative, or no fitness effects on one or both partners. The &#x2018;net&#x2019; fitness effects of all interactions between two partners, including competition, on the two partners can be represented as two symbols in a square bracket. There are six possibilities:[&#x223c; &#x223c;] (no fitness effects other than those from baseline competition), [&#x223c; &#x2191;] (commensalism, in which one partner experiences nothing more than competition whereas the other enjoys an overall fitness benefit even when competition has been taken into consideration), [&#x223c; &#x2193;] (amensalism), [&#x2193; &#x2193;] (mutual antagonism), [&#x2193; &#x2191;] (victim-exploiter), and [&#x2191; &#x2191;] (cooperation). The identities of partners may be added to the notation such that A[&#x2193; &#x2191;]B would mean that the overall interaction (including competition) inhibits A and promotes B. Under this notation, inter-population toxin-warfare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vetsigian et al., 2011</xref>) would be [&#x2193; &#x2193;] while inter-population cooperation based on the exchange of distinct net benefits would be [&#x2191; &#x2191;]. Some interactions may at the first sight seem cooperative, but the net interaction may turn out not to be cooperative after considering the negative effects of competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2008</xref>). In the game theory definition, cooperative acts incur fitness costs to the performers. Here we have taken a more liberal definition of cooperation to include mutually-beneficial interactions that may or may not involve fitness costs.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Predicting ecological patterning in simple communities using a generalized fitness model</title><p>To search for ecological patterning rules in microbial communities, we built a three-dimensional fitness model that ignored molecular details and instead focused on the fitness effects of interactions (&#x2018;The fitness model&#x2019; in &#x2018;Materials and methods&#x2019;). Specifically, two populations of cells, marked as red and green, were initially randomly distributed on a surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Cells grew horizontally until sufficiently confined, at which point they grew upward to accommodate the birth of new cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1&#x2014;figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Thus, no active cell motility was present during community growth. The growth rate of a focal cell was determined by its basal fitness as a single cell and by its interactions with other cells in a defined interaction neighborhood. To reflect the negative fitness effects of intra- and inter-population competition for shared resources ([&#x223c; &#x223c;]), the fitness of the focal cell was decreased as the total population size in the interaction neighborhood increased. In addition, the focal and partner cells affected each other&#x2019;s fitness positively (&#x2191;), negatively (&#x2193;), or neutrally (&#x223c;). The magnitude of fitness effect is quantitative. Thus, to obtain qualitative ecological patterning rules, we focused on strong interactions in which &#x2191; and &#x2193; exert fitness effects large enough to be comparable to the recipient&#x2019;s basal fitness. In most simulations using the fitness model, the basal fitnesses of both partners were non-zero, and therefore &#x2191; represented strong facultative interactions: a participant could survive on its own at its basal fitness but fared much better in the presence of its partner.<media id="video1" content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" xlink:href="elife00230v001.wmv" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="wmv"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00230.008</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><p>Yeast cells bud to the sides when there is available space and bud upward when sufficiently confined (corresponding to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1&#x2014;figure supplement 1A</xref>). To infer the process of cell rearrangement in three-dimensional communities, we monitored how single YFP-fluorescent yeast cells grew into microcolonies on top of solid agarose. Initially, dividing cells pushed other cells to the side such that all cells remained in the same plane. When a cell was sufficiently confined from the sides by other cells (approximately within a 5-cell radius), it could no longer bud to the side and instead budded upward, as indicated by higher intensities in the fluorescence images. Continued growth of microcolony forced more cells in the middle to send their progeny to upper layers, while cells close to the edge could still push other cells to the side and remain on the agarose surface.

Ratio convergence requires &#x2018;balanced&#x2019; fitness. For example, for A[&#x223c; &#x2191;]B to achieve ratio convergence, the basal fitness of A must be higher than that of B and after gaining the fitness benefit from commensalism, B must be able to grow at least as fast as A. This way, a situation incompatible to ratio convergence, that is, one partner always fitter than the other, does not occur. Using engineered competitive, obligatory commensal, and obligatory cooperative yeast communities (see below), we confirmed that population ratios converged in the commensal and cooperative but not competitive communities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2&#x2014;figure supplement 1</xref>). This convergence of population ratios reflects a balance between supply and consumption when growth is limited by supply (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shou et al., 2007</xref>): if, for instance, the supplier population suddenly increased in relative abundance, then each individual in the consumer population would receive more benefit and grow faster, which would return the ratio to its original value.</p><p>We next examined patterns in vertical cross-sections of communities simulated by the fitness model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, parameters in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1&#x2014;source data 1</xref>), because patterning along the <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> directions can depend on the initial spatial distribution of cells whereas patterning along the vertical <italic>z</italic> direction results from growth under the fitness influences of ecological interactions.

Only in cooperation ([&#x2191; &#x2191;]) conferring large fitness benefits to both partners, the two partner populations appeared to be extensively &#x2018;intermixed&#x2019;, manifested as the two different cell types successively piling on top of each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).</p><p>To compare levels of intermixing in different communities, we defined an &#x2018;intermixing index&#x2019; as the average number of cell type transitions spanning community height (&#x2018;Spatial analysis&#x2019; in &#x2018;Materials and methods&#x2019;). Since the intermixing index can be a function of community height, we compared intermixing indexes of simulated communities at equivalent heights.

Specifically, the diffusion model assumed that metabolites diffused in the community and agarose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2&#x2014;figure supplement 2</xref>) and that cell growth depended on the local concentration of its limiting metabolite according to Monod&#x2019;s equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Monod, 1949</xref>). Most parameters in the diffusion model were measured experimentally (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2&#x2014;source data 1</xref>). We reasoned that if predictions from the diffusion model were consistent with experimental observations, we could use this model to simulate experiments that would be technically difficult to perform.</p><p>To examine vertical patterning in yeast communities, we first used top-view time-lapse images to infer patterns which were subsequently verified by cryosectioning. This is because confocal and two-photon microscopy cannot penetrate deep into yeast communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">V&#xe1;chov&#xe1; et al., 2009</xref>). In competitive communities, whether in the diffusion model or experiments, time-lapse top-views suggested population segregation. For equal-fitness competitive communities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, left; <xref ref-type="other" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>), individual cells (i) grew into microcolonies (ii) which continued to grow and expand until they reached neighboring microcolonies (iii).

Consequently, columns of primarily a single cell type formed, and top-views of the community remained static (compare iv and v).

Results from the diffusion model underestimated intermixing indexes because a confined cell was modeled to divide strictly vertically upward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1&#x2014;figure supplement 1</xref>) without allowing cell movements in horizontal directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3&#x2014;figure supplement 1F</xref>). (<bold>H</bold>) A conceptual model illustrates the development of intermixing over time in a strongly cooperative community with 1:1 steady-state population ratio. Local deviations from the steady-state ratio result from asymmetric partner properties and/or stochastic fluctuations in cell numbers (i). The under-abundant population (red) grows faster than its neighboring over-abundant partner (green). Due to the spatial localization of large cooperative benefits, cells near population borders grow faster than those farther away. Consequently, cells from the initially under-abundant red population at the border divide the fastest. Progeny that pile on the green partner have more access to cooperative benefits than those who do not (ii), which favors intermixing. When the previously over-abundant partner becomes under-abundant (iii), piling-up in the opposite direction occurs (iv, green on red).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00230.009">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00230.009</ext-link></p><p><supplementary-material id="SD2-data"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00230.010</object-id><label>Figure 2&#x2014;source data 1.</label><caption><p>Definitions and values of parameters used in the diffusion model.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00230.010">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00230.010</ext-link></p></caption><media xlink:href="elife00230s002.xls" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xls"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="elife00230f002"/></fig><fig id="fig2s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00230.011</object-id><label>Figure 2&#x2014;figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>In engineered yeast communities, obligatory cooperation and obligatory commensalism allow initially different partner ratios to converge over time.</title><p>Engineered yeast communities consisted of two non-mating fluorescent strains of yeast, <italic>G</italic> and <italic>R</italic>, engaged in a metabolic interaction.

We found that in both the diffusion model and experiments, equal-fitness competitive communities formed segregated columns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, left). Unequal-fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, right) and obligatory commensal communities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) displayed a layered pattern in which the top portion of a community was dominated by one partner. In contrast to competitive and obligatory commensal communities, obligatory cooperative communities appeared to show population intermixing with patches of red and green cells emerging on top of each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2&#x2014;figure supplement 4A and B</xref>). Cooperative intermixing appeared to be less in the diffusion model than in yeast communities. This is presumably because the diffusion model assumed that a confined cell would bud strictly upward whereas in yeast communities, cell divisions could stray to the side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3&#x2014;figure supplement 1F</xref>).</p><p>To compare levels of intermixing in different communities, we quantified the intermixing index of each community (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, symbols for experiments and lines for results from the diffusion model). As expected, equal-fitness competition resulted in small intermixing indexes at all community heights (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, grey). In unequal-fitness competition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, black) and obligatory commensalism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, brown), the formation of a layered pattern caused a small increase in the intermixing index that subsequently leveled off. In contrast, the intermixing index in obligatory cooperative communities increased proportionally to community height in both experiments and the diffusion model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, magenta). This proportionality suggested the existence of a characteristic patch size (&#x2018;Spatial analysis&#x2019; in &#x2018;Materials and methods&#x2019;), denoted <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf48"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mo>&#x03BB;</mml:mo><mml:mtext>z</mml:mtext><mml:mo>&#x2a;</mml:mo></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, of 10&#x2013;20 &#xb5;m. The characteristic patch size was independent of initial conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2&#x2014;figure supplement 3A</xref>). Indeed, a calculation of the patch size based on experimentally-determined release, diffusion, and consumption of exchanged metabolites yielded comparable results (&#x2018;Calculating the characteristic patch size in cooperative yeast communities&#x2019; in &#x2018;Materials and methods&#x2019;).</p><p>What caused partner intermixing during cooperation? Using the diffusion model, we found that if cooperative benefits were not spatially localized because of instant distribution of benefits throughout the community or because of excessive supply levels, intermixing was diminished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2&#x2014;figure supplement 3B</xref>). Based on this result and based on patterns observed in top-views and vertical cross-sections of cooperative communities, we propose that local deviations from the steady-state ratio coupled with localized large cooperative benefits cause partners to &#x2018;take turns&#x2019; to grow, which leads to population intermixing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). In summary, in communities engaging in strong cooperation, but not in communities governed by other types of ecological interactions, the intermixing index increases proportionally as a function of community height. This proportionality is due to a fixed patch size determined by localized nutrient supply and consumption.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Strongly cooperative partners intermix under a wide range of conditions</title><p>Under what conditions can we observe partner intermixing in cooperation? First, we experimentally tested partner intermixing in obligatory yeast cooperative communities initiated under different population ratios and densities. Next, we used the diffusion model to examine communities in which obligatory cooperative partners interacted with different dynamics. Finally, using the fitness model, we tested intermixing in facultative cooperation by varying the relative magnitude of cooperative benefits compared to the basal fitness of the two interacting populations. We utilized yeast communities when experimentally possible and otherwise took advantage of the diffusion and the fitness models.</p><p>We found that intermixing was insensitive to initial conditions in the yeast obligatory cooperative communities. The initial partner ratio did not significantly affect the level of intermixing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3&#x2014;figure supplement 1D</xref>). At very high initial cell densities, we observed significant intermixing in communities directly above the inoculation area even in the absence of cooperation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3&#x2014;figure supplement 1E</xref>, yellow shading). This is because high cell densities put different cell types in close proximity to one another, and cell divisions that were not perfectly straight upward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3&#x2014;figure supplement 1F</xref>) caused intermixing. However, we reasoned that communities beyond the inoculation area might reveal patterns indicative of the underlying interactions, because these regions are formed by cell growth under the fitness influences of interactions. To test this possibility, we spotted cell mixtures at high densities on agarose and allowed the community to expand to new territories beyond the inoculation area. Even though communities directly above the inoculum always appeared highly intermixed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, &#x2018;Center&#x2019; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2&#x2014;figure supplement 4C</xref>), in edge sections, significant intermixing was only observed in cooperative communities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, &#x2018;Edge&#x2019; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2&#x2014;figure supplement 4D</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00230.019</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Strongly cooperating populations intermix under a wide range of conditions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In engineered yeast communities, even though both obligatory cooperative and non-cooperative communities directly above the high-density inoculation spot showed high population intermixing (&#x2018;Center&#x2019;), edge sections (&#x2018;Edge&#x2019;) of obligatory cooperative communities showed significantly more intermixing than those from non-cooperative communities (Mann&#x2013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> test, <italic>p</italic>&#x3c;5 &#xd7; 10<sup>&#x2212;5</sup>).

We examined symmetric obligatory cooperation by assuming that for the two partners, all live cells released nutrients at a constant and identical rate without delay, and that other properties such as rates of growth, death, and nutrient consumption were also identical. Partner intermixing in this symmetric obligatory cooperative system (Sym. coop) was similar to that in asymmetric obligatory yeast cooperative system (Coop). Simulated communities started from total 500 cells/mm<sup>2</sup> at 1:1 population ratio. (<bold>D</bold>) Cooperative intermixing is insensitive to initial ratios. Engineered yeast communities were initiated at a total cell density of 3000 cells/cm2 and grown to near the carrying capacity of the agarose column. Box plots show 25th to 75th percentile values of the intermixing index, with the median marked with a line and whiskers extending to 95% confidence interval. To facilitate comparisons, intermixing indexes in communities with different heights were linearly normalized to correspond to a height of &#x223c;40 cell layers (200 &#xb5;m).

Large intermixing indexes at high initial cell densities were due to the fact that the budding direction of a cell under spatial confinement was not exactly vertical (<bold>F</bold>). To facilitate comparisons, intermixing indexes in communities with different heights were linearly normalized to correspond to a height of &#x223c;30 cell layers (150 &#xb5;m).

(<bold>F</bold>) An equal-fitness competitive community was initiated at confluent density (50000 cells/mm<sup>2</sup>) and R:G &#x3d; 100:1 to ensure that single green cells were laterally confined by red cells. Cross-sections showed that the early progeny of a single cell was distributed in a division zone of &#x223c;3-cell rather than 1-cell width. Lateral budding by late progeny further widens the zone to &#x223c;5-cell diameter in a mature community.

As described above, in the diffusion model, excessive supply amounts or instant distribution of benefits throughout the community diminished intermixing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2&#x2014;figure supplement 3B</xref>). The former can occur if the local availability of cooperative benefits is not growth-limiting. However, cooperative benefits are unlikely to be available in large excess because of the potential fitness cost of generating benefits and because of competition for these benefits in the partner population. As far as diffusion is considered, the diffusion model showed significant population intermixing in obligatory cooperative communities with diffusion constants varying more than 10-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3&#x2014;figure supplement 1A</xref>).

This result is intuitive: facultative cooperation should resemble obligatory cooperation if fitness benefits are large for both partners. When only one partner receives a large fitness benefit, facultative cooperation should resemble obligatory commensalism. Finally, small fitness benefits for both partners will make facultative cooperation resemble competition. In facultative cooperation with smaller fitness benefits, intermixing would be apparent if communities could grow to greater heights. Further experiments are required to test these predictions. Together, these results suggest that intermixing relies on spatial localization of cooperative benefits that are sufficiently large to both partners, and is otherwise insensitive to initial conditions or the detailed kinetics of interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Communities of naturally mutualistic microbes exhibit intermixing</title><p>To test whether cooperative patterning applies to other biological systems, we examined redox-coupling in a two-species methane-producing biofilm consisting of the bacterium <italic>Desulfovibrio vulgaris</italic> and the archaeon <italic>Methanococcus maripaludis</italic>.

To test whether intermixing between cooperators was affected by other members of a community, we used the fitness model to simulate communities composed of five interacting species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5&#x2014;figure supplement 1</xref>).

A total of 240 pair-wise interactions in 24 independent communities were examined in the fitness model.

Here, we examined how the net fitness effects of cell&#x2013;cell interactions could influence patterning. Using defined mathematical and biological systems under controlled spatial environments, we have established two expectations for ecological patterning between two interacting partners.</p><p>The first expectation is that interactions conferring large fitness benefits to at least one partner ([&#x2191; &#x2191;], [&#x223c; &#x2191;], and [&#x2193; &#x2191;]) can potentially result in ratio convergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1&#x2014;figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2&#x2014;figure supplement 1</xref>). Ratio convergence confers stability to community composition. The composition of a community is defined to be locally (or globally) stable if after small (or any-size) deviations from it, either due to initial conditions different from it or perturbations, the community eventually returns to this composition. An analytical calculation based on the fitness model showed that in [&#x2191; &#x2191;] and [&#x223c; &#x2191;], global stability can be achieved whereas in [&#x2193; &#x2191;], local stability can be achieved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1&#x2014;figure supplement 2</xref>; &#x2018;Requirements for steady-state ratios in the six types of communities&#x2019; in &#x2018;Materials and methods&#x2019;). Experimentally, obligatory cooperation and obligatory commensalism led disparate initial ratios to converge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2&#x2014;figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, in competition between two populations of equal fitness, population ratio is determined by the initial value until a perturbation resets the value which will remain unchanged until the next perturbation. In competition between two populations of unequal fitness, the fitter population should increase in frequency and therefore, population ratio is unstable. In amensalism and mutual antagonism, population ratios at best have an unstable fixed point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1&#x2014;figure supplement 2B</xref>). This means that even if the population ratio may seem &#x2018;fixed&#x2019;, slight deviations will send it farther and farther away from the original fixed value. The reason for this instability, using mutual antagonism as an example, is because if A inhibits B and B inhibits A (A[&#x2193; &#x2193;]B), then an increase in population A will facilitate inhibition of B and therefore make B less able to inhibit A, further increasing the relative abundance of A.</p><p>The second expectation is that strong cooperation results in partner intermixing in the direction vertical to the surface of initial colonization. Cooperative intermixing requires spatially localized benefits that are sufficiently large to both partners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2&#x2014;figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), and otherwise appears to be robust against variations in initial conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2&#x2014;figure supplement 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3&#x2014;figure supplement 1D</xref>) or reaction dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3&#x2014;figure supplement 1A&#x2013;C</xref>). We have observed cooperative intermixing in the fitness model simulating strong facultative cooperation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and in obligatory experimental systems including engineered yeast communities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and syntrophic biofilms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The intermixing indexes in these communities increased linearly as a function of community height, because these communities exhibited fixed-size patches associated with the spatial localization of benefits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2&#x2014;figure supplement 3</xref>; &#x2018;Calculating the characteristic patch size in cooperative yeast communities&#x2019; in &#x2018;Materials and methods&#x2019;). This is in stark contrast with other ecological interactions which lead to segregated or layered patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figures 1 and 2</xref>) in which the intermixing index remained low or increased transiently before leveling off. In simulated multi-species communities, strongly cooperative pairs intermixed in most cases; cases where cooperative pairs did not intermix or non-cooperative pairs intermixed were likely caused by strong indirect interactions through other partners. In a theoretical study using a one-dimensional stepping-stone model, strongly cooperating partners also appeared much more mixed than competing partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Korolev and Nelson, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Our work defines the expected pattern created by pair-wise interactions if the fitness effects of interactions are the main driving force of patterning. The generality of these ecological patterning conclusions awaits further experimental validations. Many simple communities grown in laboratory environments conform to these findings. For instance, competing bacterial species form a columnar or layered pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Palmer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kreth et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">An et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hallatschek et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bernstein et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>Burkholderia</italic> sp. LB400 and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sp. B13(FR1) show spatial segregation as competitors when grown on citrate, but when grown on chlorobiphenyl they engage in metabolic commensalism and exhibit a layered pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nielsen et al., 2000</xref>). Similarly, when grown on a non-selective carbon source, <italic>Comamonas testosteroni</italic> WDL7 outcompeted and covered <italic>Variovorax</italic> sp. WDL1, but when fed with an aromatic compound as the sole carbon source, competition switched to cooperation and the two populations intermixed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Breugelmans et al., 2008</xref>). Cooperative oral bacteria species intermixed when grown on saliva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Palmer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib201">Periasamy and Kolenbrander, 2009</xref>). If cooperative intermixing is suspected, then examining whether the intermixing index increases linearly as a function of community height will be informative to exclude transient increases.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Deviations from the expected ecological patterns suggest other major patterning forces</title><p>We have described the expected patterning between two cell populations if the fitness effects of interactions are the major driving force. These expectations are abstract in the sense that in reality, no interactions can exist in the absence of molecular mechanisms or an abiotic environment. Assigning expected patterns to different types of ecological interactions will allow us to identify deviations from expectations. Determining the causes of such deviations will help us better understand the biology of a community.</p><p>Fitness effects of ecological interactions rely on molecular mechanisms to manifest themselves. Different types of molecular mechanisms can conceivably alter patterning. For instance, in the fitness and the diffusion models and in the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> communities, cells divide upward when sufficiently confined horizontally. This type of cell rearrangement has also been observed in bacterial colonies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kreft et al., 1998</xref>) and was adopted to model biofilm growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xavier and Foster, 2007</xref>). However, it is conceivable that if at least one population actively moves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Houry et al., 2012</xref>) or grows hyphae to penetrate the entire community, two populations might appear intermixed even if they do not cooperate. In biofilms of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, two populations differing only in fluorescent colors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Klausen et al., 2003</xref>) showed modest intermixing even though the expectation for equal-fitness competition is a columnar pattern with an intermixing index close to zero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, left). This modest intermixing was caused by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> differentiating into non-motile &#x2018;stalk&#x2019; cells that anchored to the surface and motile cells that climbed up to form the mushroom-like caps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Klausen et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Environmental influences can also alter ecological patterning. For instance, if two cooperating populations have very different preferences for oxygen, then the two populations are likely not to intermix and instead form layers in which the aerobic population is exposed to oxygen while the anaerobic population is protected from oxygen.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>What can cause variability in patterning?</title><p>Variability in patterning has been observed within and between communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Christensen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wilmes et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dekas et al., 2009</xref>), even if they were grown in laboratory-controlled environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Christensen et al., 2002</xref>). Stochastic events such as environmental variability, mutations, or fluctuations in initial conditions can all lead to variable patterns. For instance, if the straight-columnar pattern expected for equal-fitness competition is observed for the majority of community but a layered pattern is observed in occasional locations, then fitter mutants may have arisen in these locations, initiating unequal-fitness competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hallatschek et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Korolev et al., 2012</xref>). For mutually antagonistic interactions, the fitness model showed that population ratios can quickly diverge. Thus, which population eventually dominates depends on the initial population ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1&#x2014;figure supplement 3</xref>). In this case, stochastic variations in initial conditions can result in dramatically different patterns, giving rise to a phenomenon equivalent to &#x2018;survival of the first&#x2019;. Indeed, different patterns have been observed for communities formed by two antagonistic bacteria species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kuramitsu et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our work is conceptually analogous to that of the competitive exclusion principle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gause, 1934</xref>). The competitive exclusion principle, also known as Gause&#x2019;s law, states that two species competing for the exact same resources cannot stably coexist. Analogous to how the competitive exclusion principle has created a framework to examine forces that cause species coexistence, our work on ecological patterning will hopefully lay the ground for examining mechanisms that shape patterning in microbial communities. We encourage comments, especially those pertaining to the generality of our conclusions, to be posted to the eLife website.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials&#x7c;methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Engineering yeast strains</title><p>In competitive communities, equal-fitness <italic>G</italic> and <italic>R</italic> strains were respectively WS931 (<italic>MATa ste3::kanMX4 trp1-289::pRS404</italic>(<italic>TRP</italic>)<italic>-ADHp-venus-YFP</italic>) and WS937 (<italic>MATa ste3::kanMX4 trp1-289::pRS404</italic>(<italic>TRP</italic>)<italic>-ADHp-DsRed.T4</italic>), both from the S288C background.

Simulations were typically performed over an agarose domain of 0.75-mm length &#xd7; 0.75-mm width &#xd7; 24-mm depth and a community domain of 0.75-mm length &#xd7; 0.75-mm width &#xd7; 0.3-mm height with parameters listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2&#x2014;source data 1</xref>.</p><p>Nutrient concentrations as a function of space and time are based on the diffusion equation<disp-formula id="equ5"><label>(3)</label><mml:math id="m5"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo>&#x2202;</mml:mo><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>&#x2202;</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>&#x3d;</mml:mo><mml:mo>&#x2207;</mml:mo><mml:mo>&#xd7;</mml:mo><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x2207;</mml:mo><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mo>&#x2212;</mml:mo><mml:mi>U</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x2b;</mml:mo><mml:mi>Q</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula>with<disp-formula id="equ6"><label>(4)</label><mml:math id="m6"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>U</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x3d;</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mfrac><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x2b;</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>M</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:msub><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula><disp-formula id="equ7"><label>(5)</label><mml:math id="m7"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Q</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x3d;</mml:mo><mml:mi>&#x03C1;</mml:mi><mml:mtext>&#x2009;</mml:mtext><mml:msub><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>q</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>.</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p><xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation (3)</xref> states that <italic>S</italic>, the amount of limiting nutrient in a diffusion grid, depends on three processes: i) diffusion of nutrient with diffusion constant <italic>D</italic>, ii) uptake of nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Walther et al., 2005</xref>) by cells (<italic>U</italic>), and iii) in cooperative communities, release of nutrients by the partner population (<italic>Q</italic>).

Initially, each cell budded in the same plane and pushed others in its immediate neighborhood to the side. Once a cell was completely surrounded on each side by roughly five cells, it budded upward. The same process was implemented in the diffusion model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2&#x2014;figure supplement 2</xref>). It should be noted that by forcing the confined cells to bud strictly upward, the model underestimates intermixing. As a result, communities show more vertical features in simulations than experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p><p>Temporally, the update time-step for nutrient diffusion and uptake (&#x223c;1 s) was smaller than that for cell division and death (&#x223c;360 s). Spatially, cell actions took place on a cell grid with single-cell resolution (5 &#x3bc;m), while nutrient distributions were followed on a diffusion grid at lower spatial resolution (&#x223c;15 to 60 &#x3bc;m). These values were selected considering the trade-off between simulation time and accuracy, while ensuring the stability of simulations. For instance, at each time-step within a diffusion grid, the total amount of nutrients consumed should be considerably smaller than available nutrients. In other words, assuming that the length of a diffusion grid is <italic>nc</italic> where <italic>c</italic> is the length of a cell grid which is equivalent to the size of a cell, there are at most <italic>n</italic><sup>3</sup> cells in each diffusion grid and<disp-formula id="equ9"><label>(7)</label><mml:math id="m9"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:mo>&#x3e;</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:msub><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x2b;</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>M</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula>where <italic>S</italic> is the concentration of the limiting nutrient in the spatial grid, <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>MM</italic></sub> is the Michaelis-Menten coefficient for nutrient uptake, <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> is the maximum uptake rate, and <italic>dt</italic><sub><italic>u</italic></sub> is the uptake time-step.

Your article has been evaluated by a Senior Editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing Editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing Editor has assembled the following comments based on the reviewers&#x2019; reports.</p><p>The study deals with a very interesting mixture of experimental, theoretical, and simulation approaches to arrive at basic rules of spatial patterning between obligatory cooperative partners in single-celled systems. The studies are based on a previously developed system of two yeast strains that can enter cooperative interactions. The present paper deals with the development of a spatial patterning model in conjunction with a series of experiments that use different starting conditions to infer the stability of the observed patterns. The results of these experiments are then compared with the respective simulation results to validate the theoretical approach. This in turn is taken to infer further, more complex interactions in multi-partner systems. An additional experimental validation comes from the use of two bacterial species that interact on biochemically very different principles.</p><p>The referees agree that the paper is very interesting, technically sound, and the whole work rests on a very rich database. The main research question addressed is certainly significant, and the authors elegantly investigate it by using a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches. There are no severe methodological problems that need to be addressed. However, there are some concerns about the generality of the findings. The current version reads in places as if general rules were derived; but, strictly speaking, they are only tested for systems with obligate cooperation. Also, the possibility of antagonistic interactions is not addressed at all. Still, it appears that the paper is a very strong starting point for future work into extended directions. Hence, we will by happy to offer publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, provided the following points are addressed in a revised version.</p><p>A) The authors should be very explicit about the limitations of their current study, as well as the strengths. This could be presented in an extended discussion.</p><p>B) One of the reviewers suggests additional experiments in this context, but after further discussions, we consider them to be optional:</p><p>&#x201c;The authors investigate a very special case of cooperation, namely an obligate interaction. Both their synthetic yeast system and the Desulfovibrio&#x2013;Methanococcus interaction represent a case of an obligate interaction: that is, none of the two partners can grow without the respective other. In this light, the finding that cooperative interactions mix more than other ecological interactions seems much less surprising. It may simply be the consequence of the properties that were previously built into the system by the experimenter (i.e., the obligate mutual dependency) rather than a pattern that generally emerges in cooperative interactions (which are not necessarily obligate in nature). Figure 3B and Figure 2&#x2013;figure supplement 3B seems to support the interpretation that the partner intermixing observed by the authors is limited to obligatory cooperation.</p><p>Another very prominent example of cooperation in a microbial community is the cooperative production of biofilms (e.g., Rainey &#x26; Rainey 2003 <italic>Nature</italic>). Here we would also see spatial patterns in a biofilm, but I doubt that one would find the enhanced population mixing (given that two biofilm-formers were differentially labeled) as shown by the authors.</p><p>A way to manipulate the degree of mutual dependency experimentally would be to add lysine and/or adenine to the medium that is used to grow the yeast strains (as has been done to mimic the commensalism). My expectations for such an experiment would be that with more &#x2018;public goods&#x2019; added, the less tight the interaction gets and the less pronounced the population mixing will be. Such an outcome would further support the interpretation that the conclusions drawn do not apply to cooperative interactions within microbial communities in general, but be rather limited to obligate cooperative interactions.&#x201d;</p><p>Please respond to this comment either by doing the experiment or by clearly discussing these points in the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00230.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The current version reads in places as if general rules were derived; but, strictly speaking, they are only tested for systems with obligate cooperation. Also, the possibility of antagonistic interactions is not addressed at all.</italic></p><p>When we originally wrote &#x201c;general rules,&#x201d; we meant general rules on patterning driven by the fitness effects of ecological interactions. We have modified &#x201c;general rules&#x201d; to &#x201c;ecological patterning.&#x201d; We have also eliminated the usage of &#x201c;rules.&#x201d; We tested facultative cooperation in the fitness model, and, unfortunately, experiments will require a significant body of work. Antagonistic interactions were tested in the fitness model (Figure 1 and Figure 1&#x2013;figure supplement 2). We have added a discussion about antagonistic interactions.</p><p><italic>A) The authors should be very explicit about the limitations of their current study, as well as the strengths. This could be presented in an extended discussion</italic>.</p><p>We are not sure whether the &#x201c;limitations&#x201d; refer to the lack of experimental data for interactions, such as facultative cooperation, or the existence of other patterning forces that can cause deviations from the ecological patterning rules.</p><p>The former point is discussed below. We do not believe that the latter can be regarded as limitations of our study. There are different forces that shape patterns of communities, one of which is the fitness effects of ecological interactions between populations. We show that if such fitness effects are responsible for community patterns, strong cooperation is the only type of interaction that leads to population intermixing. To make an analogy, species coexistence is not considered a limitation of the competitive exclusion principle. There are other forces that make species not compete for exactly the same resources, and the competitive exclusion principle provides a framework of expectations that allows us to recognize and study those forces. We do agree that the original discussions on forces that cause deviations from the ecological patterning expectations could benefit from being more explicit and organized. Thus, we have expanded and reorganized discussion into three subsections.</p><p><italic>B) One of the reviewers suggests additional experiments in this context, but after further discussions, we consider them to be optional</italic>:</p><p><italic>&#x201c;The authors investigate a very special case of cooperation, namely an obligate interaction. Both their synthetic yeast system and the Desulfovibrio&#x2013;Methanococcus interaction represent a case of an obligate interaction: that is, none of the two partners can grow without the respective other. In this light, the finding that cooperative interactions mix more than other ecological interactions seems much less surprising. It may simply be the consequence of the properties that were previously built into the system by the experimenter (i.e., the obligate mutual dependency) rather than a pattern that generally emerges in cooperative interactions (which are not necessarily obligate in nature). Figure 3B and Figure 2&#x2013;figure supplement 3B seems to support the interpretation that the partner intermixing observed by the authors is limited to obligatory cooperation</italic>.</p><p>The reviewer is correct in pointing out that all our experiments were performed on obligatory cooperative systems. We only considered facultative cooperation in Figure 3B, where we showed that the larger the fitness benefits are compared to the basal fitnesses of the two partners, the more quickly intermixing index increases as a function of community height. To make this point more explicit, we have added to the main text:</p><p>&#x201c;Using the fitness model, we found that in facultative cooperation, small fitness benefits generated less intermixing than large fitness benefits (Figure 3B). This result is intuitive: patterns of facultative cooperation should resemble those of obligatory cooperation (or competition) when benefits to both partners are large (or small) compared to the basal fitnesses of cooperative partners. In facultative cooperation with smaller fitness benefits, intermixing would be apparent if communities could grow to greater heights. Further experiments are required to test these predictions.&#x201d;</p><p>In Figure 2&#x2013;figure supplement 3B, we showed that excessive benefits diminish the degree of intermixing. Excessive benefits are unrelated to whether cooperation is facultative or not. For example, if <bold>A</bold> completely depends on <bold>B</bold> for a metabolite, <bold>B</bold> can still supply this metabolite in excess.</p><p><italic>Another very prominent example of cooperation in a microbial community is the cooperative production of biofilms (e.g., Rainey &#x26; Rainey 2003 Nature). Here we would also see spatial patterns in a biofilm, but I doubt that one would find the enhanced population mixing (given that two biofilm-formers were differentially labeled) as shown by the authors</italic>.</p><p>The cooperative production of biofilm (Rainey &#x26; Rainey, 2003) relied on cooperation among cells of the <italic>same</italic> population. This type of intra-population cooperation is different from the inter-population cooperation <bold>A[</bold>&#x2191; &#x2191;<bold>]B</bold> described here, in which the benefit produced by <bold>A</bold> is different from that produced by <bold>B</bold>. We have now made this point more explicit in the main text:</p><p>&#x201c;&#x2026;, while inter-population cooperation based on the exchange of distinct benefits would be <bold>[</bold>&#x2191; &#x2191;<bold>]</bold>.&#x201d;</p><p><italic>A way to manipulate the degree of mutual dependency experimentally would be to add lysine and/or adenine to the medium that is used to grow the yeast strains (as has been done to mimic the commensalism). My expectations for such an experiment would be that with more &#x2018;public goods&#x2019; added, the less tight the interaction gets and the less pronounced the population mixing will be. Such an outcome would further support the interpretation that the conclusions drawn do not apply to cooperative interactions within microbial communities in general, but be rather limited to obligate cooperative interactions.</italic>&#x201d;</p><p>We have considered the experimental scheme proposed by the reviewer. However, we realized that if we supplement adenine and lysine to the agarose, the cells would simply exhaust the supplements first (competition) and then the interaction would switch to obligatory cooperation in addition to competition for other shared resources. One could argue that a steady supply of a very low concentration of adenine and lysine would create a facultative cooperative system, but there is no easy way of evenly supplying all cells in the community. In addition, any flow system would also wash out some of the released metabolites. To create <italic>bona fide</italic> facultative cooperation, we would need to either screen for natural microbes for facultative cooperation or create reduction-of-function (rather than loss-of-function) alleles in enzymes mediating adenine and lysine biosynthesis, and ideally these mutations should also be non-revertible. This would call for two genetic screens for appropriate mutations, which is beyond the scope of our study. Our fitness model predicts that in facultative cooperation, if for both partners the fitness benefits are large compared to the basal fitness, intermixing will increase rapidly as a function of community height (Figure 3B).</p></body></sub-article></article>
