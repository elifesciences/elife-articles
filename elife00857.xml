including Alzheimer&#x2019;s, Parkinson&#x2019;s, ALS, and diabetes type 2. While structure-based discovery of compounds has been effective in combating numerous infectious and metabolic diseases, ignorance of amyloid structure has hindered similar approaches to amyloid disease. Here we show that knowledge of the atomic structure of one of the adhesive, steric-zipper segments of the amyloid-beta (A&#x3b2;) protein of Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease, when coupled with computational methods, identifies eight diverse but mainly flat compounds and three compound derivatives that reduce A&#x3b2; cytotoxicity against mammalian cells by up to 90%. Although these compounds bind to A&#x3b2; fibers, they do not reduce fiber formation of A&#x3b2;. Structure-activity relationship studies of the fiber-binding compounds and their derivatives suggest that compound binding increases fiber stability and decreases fiber toxicity, perhaps by shifting the equilibrium of A&#x3b2; from oligomers to fibers.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00857.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00857.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00857.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease is the most common form of dementia, estimated to affect roughly five million people in the United States, and its incidence is steadily increasing as the population ages. A pathological hallmark of Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease is the presence in the brain of aggregates of two proteins: tangles of a protein called tau; and fibers and smaller units (oligomers) of a peptide called amyloid beta.</p><p>Many attempts have been made to screen libraries of natural and synthetic compounds to identify substances that might prevent the aggregation and toxicity of amyloid. Such studies revealed that polyphenols found in green tea and in the spice turmeric can inhibit the formation of amyloid fibrils. Moreover, a number of dyes reduce the toxic effects of amyloid on cells, although significant side effects prevent these from being used as drugs.</p><p>Structure-based drug design, in which the structure of a target protein is used to help identify compounds that will interact with it, has been used to generate therapeutic agents for a number of diseases. Here, Jiang et al. report the first application of this technique in the hunt for compounds that inhibit the cytotoxicity of amyloid beta. Using the known atomic structure of the protein in complex with a dye, Jiang et al. performed a computational screen of 18,000 compounds in search of those that are likely to bind effectively.</p><p>The compounds that showed the strongest predicted binding were then tested for their ability to interfere with the aggregation of amyloid beta and to protect cells grown in culture from its toxic effects. Compounds that reduced toxicity did not reduce the abundance of protein aggregates, but they appear to increase the stability of fibrils. This is consistent with other evidence suggesting that small, soluble forms (oligomers) of amyloid beta that break free from the fibrils may be the toxic agent in Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease, rather than the fibrils themselves.</p><p>In addition to uncovering compounds with therapeutic potential in Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease, this work presents a new approach for identifying proteins that bind to amyloid fibrils. Given that amyloid accumulation is a feature of many other diseases, including Parkinson&#x2019;s disease, Huntington&#x2019;s disease and type 2 diabetes, the approach could have broad therapeutic applications.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00857.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00857.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>amyloid fiber</kwd><kwd>computational biology</kwd><kwd>drug discovery</kwd><kwd>Alzheimer&#x27;s disease</kwd><kwd>ligand docking</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source>National Institutes of Health</funding-source><award-id>AG029430</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Lin</given-names></name><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Cong</given-names></name><name><surname>Eisenberg</surname><given-names>David S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source>US Department of Energy</funding-source><award-id>DE-FC02-02ER63421</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eisenberg</surname><given-names>David S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Lin</given-names></name><name><surname>Eisenberg</surname><given-names>David S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>1.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>By using structural methods to screen compounds for their ability to interact with amyloid beta, researchers have identified small molecules that stabilize amyloid fibers and reduce the toxic effect of smaller aggregates on cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein aggregates, both amyloid fibers and smaller amyloid oligomers, have been implicated in the pathology of Alzheimer&#x2019;s and other neurodegeneration diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chiti and Dobson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eisenberg and Jucker, 2012</xref>). The increasing prevalence of Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease in our aging societies, the associated tragedy for patients and their families, and the mounting economic burden for governments have all stimulated intense research into chemical interventions for this condition. Much work has been focused on screening compounds that prevent aggregation and the associated cytotoxicity of the amyloid &#x3b2;-peptide (A&#x3b2;) (reviews by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sacchettini and Kelly, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartolini and Andrisano, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hard and Lendel, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Screens have often focused on natural products from plants and lichens.

These natural polyphenolic compounds show inhibition on the fibrillation of a variety of amyloid proteins, including A&#x3b2;40 as well as &#x3b1;-synuclein, IAPP and PrP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Porat et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dasilva et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ono et al., 2012</xref>). Several dyes have also been found to ameliorate amyloid toxicity. Orcein from lichens appears to diminish toxic oligomers and enhance fiber formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bieschke et al., 2011</xref>). Congo red, thioflavin T and their analogs, commonly used as staining reagents for amyloid detection, exhibit ameliorative effects on neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer&#x2019;s, Parkinson&#x2019;s, Huntington&#x2019;s, and prion diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frid et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alavez et al., 2011</xref>), however their application is limited by significant side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Klunk et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Additional screens have identified a variety of molecules, including proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evans et al., 2006</xref>), antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kayed et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ladiwala et al., 2012</xref>), synthetic peptide mimetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Findeis, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kokkoni et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Takahashi and Mihara, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 2012</xref>) and small molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wood et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Williams et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McLaurin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Necula et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartolini and Andrisano, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Felice et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ladiwala et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hard and Lendel, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kroth et al., 2012</xref>), that inhibit A&#x3b2; fibrillogenesis and/or A&#x3b2;-associated cytotoxicity in vitro. While most efforts have targeted the deposition of A&#x3b2; fibers as the hallmark of Alzheimer&#x2019;s, smaller amyloid oligomers are now receiving greater attention as the possible toxic entities in Alzheimer&#x2019;s and other neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hartley et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cleary et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Silveira et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests that mature, end-stage amyloid fibers may serve as a reservoir, prone to releasing toxic oligomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xue et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cremades et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Krishnan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shahnawaz and Soto, 2012</xref>). Recent screens have identified compounds that reduce A&#x3b2; cytotoxicity, without interfering with A&#x3b2; fibrillation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2010</xref>) or promoting the formation of stable A&#x3b2; aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bieschke et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Structural information about protein targets often aids drug development, so here we take a structure-based approach, combined with computational screening, to discover amyloid interacting compounds that reduce amyloid toxicity. This approach has been enabled by the determination of atomic structures of the adhesive segments of amyloid fibers, termed steric zippers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nelson et al., 2005</xref>), and of solid state NMR-based structures of amyloid fibers (such as full-length A&#x3b2; fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Luhrs et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Petkova et al., 2005</xref>] and the HET-s prion domain complexed with Congo Red [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schutz et al., 2011</xref>]). The steric zipper structures reveal a common motif for the spine of amyloid fibers, in which a pair of fibrillar &#x3b2;-sheets is held together by the side-chain interdigitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sawaya et al., 2007</xref>). We focus on A&#x3b2;, a peptide of 39&#x2013;42 residues cleaved from the Amyloid precursor protein (APP) associated with Alzheimer&#x2019;s, as a target for inhibitor discovery. The segment A&#x3b2;<sub>16&#x2013;21</sub> with the sequence KLVFFA is an amyloid-forming peptide, which packs in a steric zipper form, and has been identified as the spine of the full-length A&#x3b2; fiber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Luhrs et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Petkova et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Colletier et al., 2011</xref>). Co-crystal structures have been determined for small molecules in complex with the fibrillar &#x3b2;-sheets of A&#x3b2;<sub>16&#x2013;21</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Landau et al., 2011</xref>). One of these structures&#x2014;A&#x3b2;<sub>16&#x2013;21</sub> with the dye Orange G&#x2014;reveals the specific pattern of hydrogen bonds and apolar interactions between orange G and the steric zipper: the negatively charged dye binds specifically to lysine side chains of adjacent sheets, and its planar aromatic portion packs against apolar residues (phenylalanine and valine) of adjacent sheets. By creating a tight, low energy interface across several &#x3b2;-strands within fiber core, this fiber-binding molecule appears to stabilize the fiber structure. With this atomic structure as a basis, we are able to screen for small molecular compounds that bind to amyloid fibers, stabilizing them and possibly reducing amyloid toxicity. Applying our structure-based screening procedure, we screen computationally for compounds that bind to A&#x3b2; fibers, termed BAFs (Binders of Amyloid Fibers) and then experimentally test their effects on A&#x3b2; aggregation and cytotoxicity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structure-based screening procedure</title><p>We have devised a structure-based procedure for the identification of small molecules that bind to amyloid and affect amyloid toxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

Two were found to have tighter binding than orange G, and the others gave insufficient NMR signals for detection. To expand this set of the five compounds, a second cycle of inhibitor discovery was performed. From the computed positions of the five compounds, a refined pharmacophore was inferred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), and used in the next cycle of screening.

In general, the binding sites of the traditional targets are often concave pockets; in contrast, the surfaces of amyloid fibers are flat and repetitive along the fiber axis, without well-defined surface cavities. The widely used ligand-docking software, such as DOCK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ewing et al., 2001</xref>), or AutoDock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Morris et al., 2009</xref>), is intended to fit well-defined protein pockets rather than shallow grooves at flat fiber surfaces.</p><p>Consequently we have adapted the RosettaLigand program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davis and Baker, 2009</xref>) for docking a library of commercially available compounds onto the flat surface of amyloid fibers. Similarly to other software packages, RosettaLigand scores each candidate compound for its energetic fit to its binding site. The initial site is chosen near that occupied by a bound compound, as determined in a crystal structure. The conformational flexibilities of ligand and protein side chains are modeled in a &#x2018;near-native&#x2019; perturbation fashion (&#x2018;Materials and methods&#x2019;), meaning that the fine sampling of conformations was restrained to be close to the starting conformation. To find the position along the flat fibrillar surface of greatest binding energy for each candidate compound, our screening approach leverages the rotamer repacking algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Leaver-Fay et al., 2011</xref>) and Rosetta energy function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kuhlman and Baker, 2000</xref>) to account for flexibility of protein side chains and ligand, which is critical in modeling of such shallow grooves on the fiber surface.</p><p>Our procedure identified 34 BAF compounds predicted to bind to A&#x3b2; fibers, among which eight BAFs diminish the toxicity of the fibers in mammalian cells. We suggest that the same procedure can be used to discover other compounds that reduce the toxicity of A&#x3b2; fibers, starting from other co-crystal structures of A&#x3b2; segments with other bound ligands. Similarly, the same procedure can be applied to the discovery of compounds that bind to other amyloid proteins, for use as either toxicity inhibitors or imaging agents for amyloid diagnosis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Mechanism of inhibition of A&#x3b2; toxicity</title><p>Our observation is that our tightest binding BAFs all diminish the toxicity of A&#x3b2; fibers, and yet do not substantially diminish the amount of fibers. Further study will be required to understand the molecular mechanism underlying the inhibition of A&#x3b2; toxicity, but here we offer the following hypothesis.</p><p>Emerging evidence suggest<bold>s</bold> that amyloid oligomers, rather than amyloid fibers, are toxic entities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hartley et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cleary et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Silveira et al., 2005</xref>), and that perhaps toxic oligomers can be released from amyloid fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xue et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cremades et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Krishnan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shahnawaz and Soto, 2012</xref>). By binding to fibers, BAFs stabilize them, thereby shifting the equilibrium of A&#x3b2; molecules from smaller, toxic entities towards the fibrillar state. The BAF compounds in their computationally docked sites on A&#x3b2; fibers contact several (as few as three and as many as six) adjacent &#x3b2;-strands of the fiber. By creating a low energy binding interface across several fiber strands, the BAFs apparently stabilize the A&#x3b2; fibers from breaking into smaller entities.</p><p>From previous studies, we expect BAFs to bind to amyloid fibers rather than oligomers. In recent work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Laganowsky et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2012</xref>), we proposed that amyloid forming proteins can enter either of two distinct aggregation pathways, which are separated by an energy barrier. One pathway leads to in-register fibers in which every &#x3b2;-strand lies directly above or below an identical strand in the fiber. The other pathway leads to out-of-register oligomers in which antiparallel &#x3b2;-strands are sheared relative to one another and roll into a &#x3b2;-barrel. We found that three out-of-register amyloid-like structures exhibit cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Laganowsky et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2012</xref>), which tend to be transient, equilibrating eventually into in-register fibers. In our approach, we search for BAFs based on in-register &#x3b2;-sheets rather than out-of-register &#x3b2;-strands found in toxic oligomeric structures, to which our BAFs are not expected to bind (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). We speculate that BAFs stabilize the in-register fibers revealed by our steric zippers, relative to out-of-register toxic oligomers, thereby shifting the equilibrium from toxic oligomers towards fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). Supporting this is our result that diminished toxicity accompanies compound binding.<fig-group><fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00857.031</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>BAFs are designed to bind to in-register &#x3b2;-sheets, rather than out-of-register &#x3b2;-sheets.</title><p>As illustrated in (<bold>A</bold>), BAFs bind to in-register &#x3b2;-sheets. Our structure-based approach searches for BAFs based on in-register &#x3b2;-sheets in A&#x3b2; fibers. These BAFs are predicted to bind along the flat hydrophobic surfaces of the fibers and are anchored by polar sidechains of Lysine residues. The C&#x3b2; distances between the Lys residues interacting with the BAFs are &#x223c;9.6 &#xc5; following the stacked arrangement of in-register &#x3b2;-sheets. Orange G, as well as screened BAFs, favorably interact with the in-register fiber and are compatible with the geometry of the Lys residues aligned in in-register &#x3b2;-sheets. As illustrated in (<bold>B</bold>), BAFs cannot bind to out-of-register &#x3b2;-sheets. The estimation of C&#x3b2; distance between the lysine residues, based on three out-of-register &#x3b2;-sheets structures previously determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Laganowsky et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2012</xref>), ranges from 11 &#xc5; to 14 &#xc5;, quite different from the &#x223c;9.6 &#xc5; measured in in-register &#x3b2;-sheet.

A CellTiter 96 aqueous non-radioactive cell proliferation assay kit (MTT) (Promega cat. #G4100, Madison, WI) was used. HeLa and PC-12 (ATCC; cat. # CRL-1721, Manassas, VA) cell lines were used for measuring the toxicity of A&#x3b2;<sub>1&#x2013;42</sub>. Prior to toxicity test, both HeLa and PC-12 cell lines were plated at 10,000 cells per well in 96-well plates (Costar cat. # 3596, Washington, DC). HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, PC-12 cells were cultured in ATCC-formulated RPMI 1640 medium (ATCC; cat.# 30&#x2013;2001) with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum. Cells were cultured in 96-well plates for 20 hr at 37&#xb0;C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. For A&#x3b2;<sub>1&#x2013;42</sub> and BAFs samples preparation, purified A&#x3b2;<sub>1&#x2013;42</sub> was dissolved in PBS at the final concentration of 5 &#x3bc;M, followed by the addition of BAFs at indicated concentrations. The mixtures were filtered with a 0.2-&#x3bc;m filter and further incubated for 16 hr at 37&#xb0;C without shaking for fiber formation. To start the MTT assay, 10 &#x3bc;l of pre-incubated mixture was added to each well containing 90 &#x3bc;l medium. After 24 hr incubation at 37&#xb0;C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 15 &#x3bc;l Dye solution (Promega cat. #G4102) was added into each well. After incubation for 4 hr at 37&#xb0;C, 100 &#x3bc;l solubilization Solution/Stop Mix (Promega cat. #G4101) was added to each well. After 12 hr incubation at room temperature, the absorbance was measured at 570 nm with background absorbance recorded at 700 nm. Four replicates were measured for each of the samples. The MTT cell viability assay measured the percentage of survival cell upon the treatment of the mixture of A&#x3b2;<sub>1&#x2013;42</sub> and BAFs. The toxicity inhibition (%) or rescuing percentage (%) of each BAF compound was calculated by normalizing the cell survival rate using the PBS buffer-treated cells as 100% and 0.5 &#x3bc;M (final concentration) A&#x3b2;<sub>1&#x2013;42</sub> fiber alone-treated cell as 0% viability<bold>.</bold></p></sec><sec id="s4-7-6"><title>Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)</title><p>TEM was performed to visualize the fibrillation of A&#x3b2;<sub>1&#x2013;42</sub> in presence of BAFs. The samples of A&#x3b2;<sub>1&#x2013;42</sub> and BAFs mixture for TEM measurement were the same as those for MTT assay. For specimen preparation, 5 &#x3bc;l solution was spotted onto freshly glow-discharged carbon-coated electron microscopy grids (Ted Pella, Redding, CA). Grids were rinsed twice with 5 &#x3bc;l distilled water after 3 min incubation, followed by staining with 1% uranyl acetate for 1 min. A CM120 electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 120 kV was used to examine the specimens. Images were recorded digitally by TIETZ F224HD CCD camera.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-7"><title>ThT fibrillation assay</title><p>Purified A&#x3b2;<sub>1&#x2013;42</sub> was dissolved in 10 mM NaOH at the concentration of 200 &#x3bc;M, followed by sonication for further solubilizing A&#x3b2;<sub>1&#x2013;42</sub>. A&#x3b2;<sub>1&#x2013;42</sub> was diluted into PBS buffer at the final concentration of 20 &#x3bc;M, and was mixed with 20 &#x3bc;M Thioflavin T (ThT) and different concentrations of BAFs. The reaction mixture was filtered with a 0.2 &#x3bc;m filter, split into four replicates and placed in a 96-well plate (black with flat optic bottom). The ThT fluorescence signal was measured every 5 min using the Varioskan plate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc) with excitation and emission wavelengths of 444 and 484 nm, respectively, at 37&#xb0;C.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank N Wu for help with initial computational work, R Peterson and E Hartman for help with NMR

Your article has been favorably peer reviewed by two reviewers, one of whom is a Senior editor.</p><p>The Senior editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission in which you should respond to the issues raised by the reviewers.</p><p>In this paper, David Eisenberg and colleagues use computational docking to discover small molecules that bind to and stabilize a variety of peptide fibers formed by fragments of amylogenic proteins, and in this way suppress the toxicity of amyloid fibrils of the Alzheimer&#x2019;s Abeta peptide. They validate the binding of the peptides by NMR, followed up by assays for fibril formation, and also show that the small molecules alleviate the toxicity of the amylogenic peptides to mammalian cells. This work builds on earlier results from the Eisenberg group that established high-resolution crystal structures for many different kinds of peptide fibrils and revealed how small molecules such as Orange G bind to them. The work also follows on earlier studies from others (for example, Pastore and Wanker) on the effects of small molecules on amylogenic peptides. What is new in the present work, however, is the use of computational docking to come up with novel pharmacophores. This is interesting because the binding sites on the fibrils are quite different from the deep hydrophobic cavities that are the targets of conventional docking efforts. Here, the binding sites are flat, and although hydrophobicity is still important, the small molecules lie along the flat surfaces of the fibrils and are anchored by polar residues in a way that stabilizes the fibrils.</p><p>The paper is generally clearly written and illustrated. The great interest in developing drugs against amyloid diseases as well as the creative use of computational methods towards that end makes this paper suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Major comment:</p><p>A stronger case would be made if the authors tested whether their small molecule compounds bind to and reduce toxicity of oligomers. This would be a good test of their hypothesis that their compounds target fibrils (not oligomers) and prevent toxicity by reducing the release of toxic oligomers from fibrils (i.e., shifting the equilibrium toward fibrils). Do the authors have data that can address this question, or can such data be obtained relatively easily?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00857.040</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>A stronger case would be made if the authors tested whether their small molecule compounds bind to and reduce toxicity of oligomers.

Do the authors have data that can address this question, or can such data be obtained relatively easily</italic>?</p><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this important question. To explore the possibility raised by the reviewers that our small molecule compounds (termed BAFs) might target oligomers, we designed experiments to test whether BAFs are capable of inhibiting pre-formed toxic Abeta oligomers using the MTT cell viability assay. The results of these new experiments are given in new <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl7">Table 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11&#x2014;figure supplement 1</xref>: four BAFs, which significantly reduce Abeta toxicity, show no protective effects on the toxicity of pre-formed Abeta oligomers. These data verify that BAFs detoxify Abeta42 <italic>not</italic> by targeting toxic oligomers, as requested by the reviewers.</p><p>Also there are theoretical reasons for expecting that compounds designed to bind fibers will not bind oligomers. These reasons are based on recent work (Laganowsky et al., Science 2012; Liu et al., PNAS 2012), which shows that the structural features of a toxic oligomer are distinct from those observed in fibrils. As we detail in the Discussion section of the present paper, we applied our structure-based approach to search for BAFs that bind to flat in-register &#x03B2;-sheets in fibril structures rather than out-of-register &#x03B2;-strands found in toxic oligomeric structures. As highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>, these small molecules are predicted to bind along the hydrophobic in-register &#x03B2;-sheet surfaces of the fibrils and to be anchored by polar residues (i.e., Lysine 16 of Abeta fibril in this case). The distances between the Lys residues that interact with the small molecules have distinct differences between in-register &#x03B2;-sheets (left panel) and out-of-register &#x03B2;-strands (right panel). Since we search for the small molecules (in a green color) compatible with the geometry of Lys residues in in-register &#x03B2;-sheets, these small molecules are not expected to bind out-of-register oligomer. Together with our new experimental results, we speculate that the BAFs are unable to bind to Abeta oligomers, and this difference accounts for the diminished toxicity that accompanies specific binding of the small molecules.</p></body></sub-article></article>
